<h2><em>Foreword</em></h2>


<p><em>When we regard the large share which child study
has in the interest of the reader and thinker of to-day,
it is indeed curious to see how little is told of child life
in history. The ancients made no record of the life of
young children; classic Rome furnishes no data for
child study; the Greeks left no child forms in art.
The student of original sources of history learns little
about children in his searches; few in number and
comparatively meagre in quality are the literary remains
that even refer to them.</em></p>

<p><em>We know little of the childhood days of our forbears,
and have scant opportunity to make comparisons or note
progress. The child of colonial days was emphatically
"to be seen, not to be heard"&mdash;nor was he even to be
much in evidence to the eye. He was of as little
importance in domestic, social, or ethical relations as
his childish successor is of great importance to-day; it
was deemed neither courteous, decorous, nor wise to
make him appear of value or note in his own eyes or in
the eyes of his seniors. Hence there was none of that
exhaustive study of the motives, thoughts, and acts of a
child which is now rife.</em></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_viii" id="Page_viii">[viii]</a></span></p>

<p><em>The accounts of oldtime child life gathered for this
book are wholly unconscious and full of honesty and
simplicity, not only from the attitude of the child, but
from that of his parents, guardians, and friends. The
records have been made from affectionate interest, not
from scientific interest; no profound search has been
made for motives or significance, but the proof they give
of tenderness and affection in the family are beautiful
to read and to know.</em></p>

<p><em>The quotations from manuscript letters, records,
diaries, and accounts which are here given could only
have been acquired by precisely the method which has
been followed,&mdash;a constant and distinct search for
many years, combined with an alert watchfulness for
items or even hints relating to the subject, during as
many years of extended historical reading. Many private
collections and many single-treasured relics have
been freely offered for use, and nearly all the sentences
and pages selected from these sources now appear in
print for the first time. The portraits of children
form a group as rare as it is beautiful. They are
specially valuable as a study of costume. Nearly all
of these also are as true emblems of the generous friendship
of the present owners as they are of the life of the
past. The rich stores of our many historical associations,
of the Essex Institute, the American Antiquarian
Society, the Long Island Historical Society, the Deerfield</em><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_ix" id="Page_ix">[ix]</a></span>
<em>Memorial Hall, the Lenox Library, have been
generously opened, carefully gleaned, and freely used.
The expression of gratitude so often tendered to these
helpful kinsfolk and friends and to these bountiful
societies and libraries can scarcely be emphasized by
any public thanks, yet it would seem that for such
assistance thanks could never be offered too frequently,
nor too publicly.</em></p>

<p><em>Nor have I, in gathering for this,&mdash;as for my other
books,&mdash;failed to exercise what Emerson calls "the
catlike love of garrets, presses, and cornchambers, and
of the conveniences of long housekeeping." Many long-kept
homes have I searched, many an old garret and
press has yielded conveniences for this book.</em></p>

<p><em>Though this is a record of the life of children in the
American colonies, I have freely compared the conditions
in this country with similar ones in England at
the same date, both for the sake of fuller elucidation,
and also to attempt to put on a proper basis the civilization
which the colonists left behind them. Many
statements of conditions in America do not convey correct
ideas of our past comfort and present and liberal
progress unless we compare them with facts in English
life. We must not overrate seventeenth and eighteenth
century life in England, either in private or public.
England was not a first-class power among nations till
the time of the Treaty of Paris, in 1763. When our</em><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_x" id="Page_x">[x]</a></span>
<em>colonies were settled it was third-rate. Life among
the nobility was magnificent, but the life of the peasantry
was wretched, and middle-class social life was
very bleak and monotonous in both city and country.
From early days life was much better in many ways in
America than in England for the family of moderate
means, and children shared the benefits of these better
conditions. A child's life was more valuable here.
The colonial laws plainly show this increased valuation,
and the child responded to this regard of him by a
growing sense of his own importance, which in time
has produced "Young America."</em></p>

<p><em>It is my hope that children as well as grown folk
will find in these pages much to interest them in the
accounts of the life of children of olden times. I have
had this end constantly in my mind, though I have
made no attempt, nor had I any intent, to write in a
style for the perusal of children; for I have not found
that intelligent children care much or long for such
books, except in the very rare cases of the few great
books that have been written for children, and which
are loved and read as much by the old as by the young.</em></p>

<p><em>As our tired century has grown gray it has developed
an interest in things youthful,&mdash;in the beginnings of
things. Its attitude is akin to that of an old man, still
in health and clear-headed, but weary; who has lived
through his scores of crowded years of action, toil, and</em><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xi" id="Page_xi">[xi]</a></span>
<em>strife, and seeks in the last days of his life a serene and
peaceful harbor,&mdash;the companionship of little children.
There is something of mystery, too, in "the turn of the
century" something which then makes our gaze retrospective
and comparative rather than inquisitive into the
future. Hence this year of our Lord MDCCCXCIX
has been the allotted day and hour for the writing of
this book. There has been a trend of destiny which
has brought not only a book on oldtime child
life, and that book at this century end,
but has included the fate that
it should be written by
Alice Morse Earle.
Kismet!</em>

<span class="i0">&mdash;<em>The Author's Way of Sending Forth His Second Part of the Pilgrim. John Bunyan, 1684.</em></span>
</div></div>


<p>There is something inexpressibly sad in
the thought of the children who crossed the
ocean with the Pilgrims and the fathers of
Jamestown, New Amsterdam, and Boston, and the
infancy of those born in the first years of colonial
life in this strange new world. It was hard for
grown folk to live; conditions and surroundings
offered even to strong men constant and many
obstacles to the continuance of existence; how difficult
was it then to rear children!</p>

<p>In the southern colonies the planters found a
climate and enforced modes of life widely varying
from home life in England; it took several generations
to accustom infants to thrive under those conditions.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[2]</a></span>
The first years of life at Plymouth are the
records of a bitter struggle, not for comfort but for
existence. Scarcely less sad are the pages of Governor
Winthrop's journal, which tell of the settlers
of Massachusetts Bay. On the journey across seas
not a child "had shown fear or dismayedness."
Those brave children were welcomed to the shore
with good cheer, says the old chronicler, Joshua
Scottow; "with external flavor and sweet odor;
fragrant was the land, such was the plenty of sweet
fern, laurel, and other fragrant simples; such was
the scent of our aromatic and balsam-bearing pines,
spruces and larch trees, with our tall cedars." They
landed on a beautiful day in June, "with a smell on
the shore like the smell of a garden," and these
happy children had gathered sweet wild strawberries
and single wild roses. It is easy to picture the merry
faces and cheerful laughter.</p>

<p>Scant, alas! were the succeeding days of either
sweetness or light. The summer wore on in weary
work, in which the children had to join; in constant
fears, which the children multiplied and magnified;
and winter came, and death. "There is not
a house where there is not one dead," wrote Dudley.
One little earth-weary traveller, a child whose "family
and kindred had dyed so many," was, like the
prophets in the Bible, given exalted vision through<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[3]</a></span>
sorrow, and had "extraordinary evidence concerning
the things of another world." Fierce east winds
searched the settlers through and through, and frosts
and snows chilled them. The dreary ocean, the
gloomy forests, were their bounds. Scant was their
fare, and mean their roof-trees; yet amid all the want
and cold little children were born and welcomed
with that ideality of affection which seems as immortal
as the souls of the loved ones.</p>

<p>Hunger and privation did not last long in the
Massachusetts colony, for it was a rich community&mdash;for
its day&mdash;and soon the various settlements
grew in numbers and commerce and wealth, and an
exultant note runs through their records. Prosperous
peoples will not be morose; thanksgiving
proclamations reflect the rosy hues of successful
years. Child life was in harmony with its surroundings;
it was more cheerful, but there was still
fearful menace to the life and health of an infant.
From the moment when the baby opened his eyes
on the bleak world around him, he had a Spartan
struggle for life; half the Puritan children had
scarce drawn breath in this vale of tears ere they had
to endure an ordeal which might well have given rise
to the expression "the survival of the fittest." I say
half the babies, presuming that half were born in
warm weather, half in cold. All had to be baptized<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[4]</a></span>
within a few days of birth, and baptized in the meeting-house;
fortunate, indeed, was the child of midsummer.
We can imagine the January babe carried
through the narrow streets or lanes to the freezing
meeting-house, which had grown damper and deadlier
with every wintry blast; there to be christened,
when sometimes the ice had to be broken in
the christening bowl. On January 22, 1694, Judge
Samuel Sewall, of Boston, records in his diary:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"A very extraordinary Storm by reason of the falling and
driving of Snow. Few women could get to Meeting. A
Child named Alexander was baptized in the afternoon."</p></blockquote>

<p>The Judge tells of his own children&mdash;four days
old&mdash;shrinking from the icy water, but crying not.
It was a cold and disheartening reception these children
had into the Puritan church; many lingered
but a short time therein. The mortality among
infants was appallingly great; they died singly, and
in little groups, and in vast companies. Putrid
fevers, epidemic influenzas, malignant sore throats,
"bladders in the windpipe," raging small pox,
carried off hundreds of the children who survived
baptism. The laws of sanitation were absolutely
disregarded&mdash;because unknown; drainage there was
none&mdash;nor deemed necessary; disinfection was
feebly desired&mdash;but the scanty sprinkling of vinegar<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[5]</a></span>
was the only expression of that desire; isolation
of contagious diseases was proclaimed&mdash;but
the measures were as futile when the disease was
known to be contagious as they were lacking in the
diseases which our fathers did not know were communicable.
It is appalling to think what must have
been the unbounded production and nurture of
disease germs; and we can paraphrase with truth
the words of Sir Thomas Browne, and say of our
grandfathers and their children, "Considering the
thousand roads that lead to death, I do thank my
God they could die but once."</p>

<p>It is heartrending to read the entries in many an
old family Bible&mdash;the records of suffering, distress,
and blasted hopes. Until this century these sad
stories may be found. There lies open before me an
old leather-bound Bible with the record of my great-grandfather's
family. He had sixteen children.
When the first child was a year and a half old the
second child was born. The baby was but four days
old when the older child died. Five times did that
mother's heart bear a similar cruel loss when she had
a baby in her arms; therefore when she had been
nine years married she had one living child, and five
little graves bore record of her sorrow.</p>

<p>In the seventeenth century the science of medicine
had not wholly cut asunder from astrology and necromancy;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[6]</a></span>
and the trusting Christian still believed
in some occult influences, chiefly planetary, which
governed not only his crops but his health and life.
Hence the entries of births in the Bible usually
gave the hour and minute, as well as the day, month,
and year. Thus could be accurately calculated what
favoring or mischief-bearing planets were in ascendency
at the time of the child's birth; what influences
he would have to encounter in life.</p>

<p>The belief that meteorological and astrological
conditions affected medicines was strong in all minds.
The best physicians gravely noted the condition of
the moon when gathering herbs and simples and
concocting medicines; and certain drugs were held
to be powerless at certain times of the year, owing
to planetary influences. "Sympathetical" medicines
were confidingly trusted, and tried to a surprising
extent upon children; apparently these were
as beneficial as our modern method of healing by
the insinuation of improved health.</p>

<p>We cannot wonder that children died when we
know the nostrums with which they were dosed.
There were quack medicines which held sway for a
century&mdash;among them, a valuable property, <em>Daffy's
Elixir</em>. These patented&mdash;or rather secret&mdash;medicines
had a formidable rival in snail-water, which
was used as a tonic and also a lotion. Many of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[7]</a></span>
ingredients and extracts used in domestic medicines
were incredibly revolting.</p>

<p>Venice treacle was a nasty and popular compound,
traditionally invented by Nero's physician;
it was made of vipers, white wine, opium, "spices
from both the Indies," licorice, red roses, tops of
germander and St.-John's-wort, and some twenty
other herbs, juice of rough sloes, mixed with honey
"triple the weight of all the dry spices." The
recipe is published in dispensatories till within this
century. The vipers had to be put, "twelve of
'em," into white wine alone. Mithridate, the ancient
cure-all of King Mithridates, was another dose
for children. There were forty-five ingredients in
this, each prepared and introduced with care.
Rubila, made chiefly of antimony and nitre, was
beloved of the Winthrops, and frequently dispensed
by them&mdash;and with benefit.</p>

<p>Children were grievously afflicted with rickets,
though curiously enough it was a new disease, not
old enough to have received adequate observation
in England, wrote Sir Thomas Browne in the latter
part of the seventeenth century. Snails furnished
many doses for the rickets.</p>

<p>Exact instruction of treatment for the rickets is
given in a manuscript letter written to Rev. Joseph
Perry of Windsor, Connecticut, in 1769:&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span></p>

<blockquote>

<p>
"<span class="smcap">Rev'D Sir</span>:
</p>

<p>"In ye Rickets the best Corrective I have ever
found is a Syrup made of Black Cherrys. Thus. Take
of Cherrys (dry'd ones are as good as any) &amp; put them
into a vessel with water. Set ye vessel near ye fire and
let ye water be Scalding hot. Then take ye Cherrys into
a thin Cloth and squeeze them into ye Vessell, &amp; sweeten
ye Liquor with Melosses. Give 2 Spoonfuls of this 2 or
3 times in a day. If you Dip your Child, Do it in this
manner: viz: naked, in ye morning, head foremost in
Cold Water, don't dress it Immediately, but let it be made
warm in ye Cradle &amp; sweat at least half an Hour moderately.
Do this 3 mornings going &amp; if one or both feet are
Cold while other Parts sweat (which is sometimes ye Case)
Let a little blood be taken out of ye feet ye 2nd Morning
and yt will cause them to sweat afterwards. Before
ye dips of ye Child give it some Snakeroot and Saffern
Steep'd in Rum &amp; Water, give this Immediately before
Diping and after you have dipt ye Child 3 Mornings Give
it several times a Day ye following Syrup made of Comfry,
Hartshorn, Red Roses, Hog-brake roots, knot-grass, petty-moral
roots, sweeten ye Syrup with Melosses. Physicians
are generally fearful about diping when ye Fever is hard,
but oftentimes all attemps to lower it without diping are
vain. Experience has taught me that these fears are
groundless, yt many have about diping in Rickety Fevers;
I have found in a multitude of Instances of diping is most
effectual means to break a Rickety Fever. These Directions
are agreable to what I have practiced for many years."</p></blockquote>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span></p>

<p>Among other English notions thrust upon American
children was one thus advertised in ante-Revolutionary
newspapers:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">"The Famous Anodyne Necklace</span><br />

"<em>price 20 shillings</em></p>

<p>"For children's teeth, recommended in England by
Dr. Chamberlen, with a remedy to open and ease the
foregums of teething children and bring their teeth safely
out. Children on the very brink of the Grave and thought
past recovery with their teeth, fits, fevers, convulsions,
hooping and other violent coughs, gripes, looseness, and all
proceeding from their teeth who cannot tell what they
suffer nor make known their pains any other way but by
crying and moans, have almost miraculously recovered
after having worn the famous Anodyne Necklace but one
night's time. A mother then would never forgive herself
whose child should die for want of so very easy a remedy
for its teeth. And what is particularly remarkable of this
necklace is, that of those vast numbers who have had this
necklace for their children, none have made any complaints
but express how glad they have been that their children
have worn it whereas if they had not had it, they believed
their children would have been in the grave, all means
having been used in vain until they had the necklace."</p></blockquote>

<p>These anodyne necklaces were akin to the medicated
belts of our own day, and were worn as children
still wear amber beads to avert the croup.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span></p>

<p>Various native berries had restorative and preventive
properties when strung as a necklace. Uglier decorations
were those recommended by Josselyn to New
England parents, strings of fawn's teeth or wolf's
fangs, a sure promoter of easy teething. He also
advised scratching the child's gums with an osprey
bone. Children died, however, in spite of these
varied charms and doses, in vast numbers while
teething.</p>

<p>There were some feeble expressions of revolt
against the horrible doses of the day. In 1647 we
hear of the publication of "a Most Desperate<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span>
Booke written against taking of Phissick," but it
was promptly ordered to be burnt; and the doses
were continued until well into this century. The
shadow of their power lingers yet in country homes.</p>

<p>Many alluring baits were written back to England
by the first emigrants to tempt others to follow to
the new world. Among other considerations
Gabriel Thomas made this statement:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"The Christian children born here are generally well-favored
and beautiful to behold. I never knew any to
come into the world with the least blemish on any part
of the body; being in the general observed to be better-natured,
milder, and more tender-hearted than those born
in England."</p></blockquote>

<p>John Hammond lavished equal praise on the
children in Virginia. It was also asserted that
the average number of children in a family was
larger, which is always true in a pioneer settlement
in a new country. The promise of the Lord
is ever fulfilled that he will "make the families of
his servants in the wilderness like a flock."</p>

<p>A cheerful home life was insured by these large
families when they lived. Sir William Phips was
one of twenty-six children, all with the same mother.
Green, the Boston printer, had thirty children.
Another printer, Benjamin Franklin, was one of a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span>
family of seventeen. William Rawson had twenty
children by one wife. Rev. Cotton Mather tells
us:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"One woman had not less than twenty-two children,
and another had no less than twenty-three children by one
husband, whereof nineteen lived to man's estate, and a
third was mother to seven and twenty children."</p></blockquote>

<p>He himself had fifteen children, though but two
survived him. Other ministers had larger families.
Rev. John Sherman, of Watertown, Massachusetts,
had twenty-six children by two wives. Rev. Samuel
Willard, the first minister of Groton, Massachusetts,
had twenty children, and was himself one of
seventeen children. It is to the honor of these
poorly paid ministers that they brought up these
large families well. Rev. Abijah Weld, of Attleboro,
Massachusetts, had an annual salary of about
two hundred and twenty dollars. He had a small
farm and a decent house; he lived in generous
hospitality, entertaining many visitors and contributing
to the wants of the poor. He had fifteen
children and reared a grandchild. In his fifty-five
years of service as a minister he was never detained
from his duties nor failed to perform them.</p>

<p>Rev. Moses Fiske had sixteen children; he sent
three sons to college and married off all his daughters;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span>
his salary was never over ninety pounds, and
usually but sixty pounds a year, paid chiefly in corn
and wood. One verse of a memorial poem to
Mrs. Sarah Thayer reads:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem">
<span class="i0">"And one thing more remarkable<br /></span>
<span class="i3">Which here I shall record;<br /></span>
<span class="i1">She'd fourteen children with her<br /></span>
<span class="i3">At the table of her Lord."<br /></span>
</div>

<p>These large families were eagerly welcomed.
Children were a blessing. The Danish proverb
says, "Children are the poor man's wealth." To
the farmer, especially the frontiersman, every child
in the home is an extra producer. No town in
New England had less land to distribute than
Boston, but on all allotments women and children
received their full proportion; the early allotments
of land in Brookline (then part of Boston) were
made by "heads," that is, according to the number
of people in the family.</p>

<p>It is an interesting study to trace the underlying
reason for naming children many of the curious
names which were given to the offspring of the first
colonists. Parents searched for names of deep significance,
for names appropriate to conditions, for
those of profound influence&mdash;presumably on the
child's life. Glory to God and zealous ambition<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span>
for the child's future were equally influential in deciding
selection.</p>

<div class="caption"><p class="center">Townes Cradle</p></div>
</div>

<p>Rev. Richard Buck, one of the early parsons in
Virginia, in days of deep depression named his first
child Mara. This text indicates the reason for his
choice: "Call me Mara for the Almighty hath dealt
very bitterly with me. I went out full and the
Lord hath brought me home empty." His second
child was christened Gershom; for Moses' wife
"bare him a son and called his name Gershom, for
he said I have been in a strange land." Eber, the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span>
Hebrew patriarch, called his son Peleg, "for his
days were divided." Mr. Buck celebrated the
<em>Pelegging</em>, or dividing of Virginia, into legislative
districts by naming his third child Peleg. Many
names have a pathos and sadness which can be felt
down through the centuries. Dame Dinely, widow
of a doctor or barber-surgeon who had died in
the snow while striving to visit a distant patient,
named her poor babe Fathergone. A little Goodman
child, born after the death of her father,
was sadly but trustingly named Abiel&mdash;<em>God is
my father</em>. Seaborn was the name indicative of
the introduction into life of one of my own
ancestors.</p>

<p>In the old Ropes Bible in Salem is given the
reason for an unusual name which often appears in
that family; it is Seeth. One of the family was
supposed to be dead, having disappeared. On his
sudden reappearance a pious Ropes exclaimed in
joy, "The Lord seeth not as man seeth, and my
child shall be named Seeth." An early example of
the name is Seeth Grafton, who became the wife of
Thomas Gardner in 1636.</p>

<p>Judge Sewall named one son Joseph,</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"In hopes of the accomplishment of the Prophecy of
Ezekiel xxxvii. and such; and not out of respect to any
Relation or any other Person except the first Joseph."</p></blockquote>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span></p>

<p>Judge Sewall again made an entry in his diary
after a christening.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"I named my little Daughter Sarah. Mr. Torrey said
call her Sarah and make a Madam of her. I was struggling
whether to call her Mehetable or Sarah. But when I saw
Sarah's standing in the Scripture, viz: Peter, Galatians,
Hebrews, Romans, I resolv'd on that suddenly."</p></blockquote>

<p>Abigail, meaning father's joy, was also frequently
given, and Hannah, meaning grace; the history of
these two Hebrew women made their names honored
of New England Puritans. Zurishaddai, the
Almighty is my rock, was bestowed on more than
one boy. Comfort, Deliverance, Temperance,
Peace, Hope, Patience, Charity, Faith, Love, Submit,
Endurance, Silence, Joy, Rejoice, Hoped for,
and similar names indicative of a trait of character, a
virtue, or an aspiration of goodness, were common.
The children of Roger Clap were named Experience,
Waitstill, Preserved, Hopestill, Wait, Thanks,
Desire, Unite, and Supply. Madam Austin, an
early settler of old Narragansett, had sixteen children.
Their names were Parvis, Picus, Piersus,
Prisemus, Polybius, Lois, Lettice, Avis, Anstice,
Eunice, Mary, John, Elizabeth, Ruth, Freelove.
All lived to be threescore and ten, one to be a hundred
and two years old.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span></p>

<p>Edward Bendall's children were named Truegrace,
Reform, Hoped for, More mercy, and Restore.
Richard Gridley's offspring were Return,
Believe, and Tremble.</p>

<p>With the exception of Puritanical names, double
Christian names were very rare until after the Revolution,
as may be seen by examining any document
with many signatures; such, for instance, as the
Declaration of Independence, or the lists of officers
and men in the Continental Army. Return Jonathan
Meigs was a notable exception.</p>

<p>There exists in New England a tradition of
"groaning-cakes" being made and baked at the
birth of a child, to give to visitors. I have found
no record of it. The Frenchman, Misson, in his
<cite>Travels in England</cite>, says, "At the birth of their
children they (visitors) drink a glass of wine and
eat a bit of a certain cake, which is seldom made
but upon these occasions." Anna Green Winslow,
a Boston schoolgirl, tells of making what she calls
"a setting up visit" to a relative who had a baby
about four weeks old. She wore her best and most
formal attire and says, "It cost me a pistareen
to Nurse Eaton for two cakes which I took care
to eat before I paid for them." There certainly
was a custom of giving money, clothing, or petty
trinkets to the nurse at such visits. Judge Sewall<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span>
frequently writes of these "vails" which he made
at the house of his friends. He writes in one
case of brewing "groaning-beer," and in his household
were held two New England amphidromia.
The midwife, nurses, and all the neighboring
women who had helped with work or advice during
the early days of the child's life were bidden to
a dinner. One Sewall baby was scarcely two weeks
old when seventeen women dined at the Judge's
house, on boiled pork, beef, and fowls; roast beef
and turkey; pies and tarts. At another time
"minc'd Pyes and cheese" were added. Judge
Winthrop's sister, Madam Downing, furnished sack
and claret also. A survival of this custom lasted till
this century in the drinking of caudle by the bedside
of the mother.</p>

<p>A pincushion was for many years and indeed is
still in some parts of New England a highly conventional
gift to a mother with a young babe.</p>

<p><cite>Poor Robin's Almanack</cite> for the year 1676 says:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem">
<span class="i0">"Pincushions and such other knacks<br /></span>

<p>I have seen in different families five of precisely
the same pattern and size, all made about the time
of the Revolution. One given to a Boston baby,
while his new home was in state of siege, bore th<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span>e
inscription, "Welcome little Stranger, tho' the Port
is closed." These words were formed by the heads
of pins. Another, about five inches long and
three inches wide, is of green figured silk with a
flowered vine stuck in pins and the words, "John
Winslow, March, 1783, Welcome, Little Stranger."
Anna Green Winslow tells of her aunts making one
with "a planthorn of flowers" and the name. I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span>
have seen one with similar inscription knitted of
fine silk and with the name sewed on in steel beads,
among which pins were stuck in a graceful pattern.</p>

<div class="caption"><p class="center">Indian Cradle</p></div>
</div>

<p>The seventeenth-century baby slept, as his nineteenth-century
descendant does, in a cradle. Nothing
could be prettier than the old cradles that have
survived successive years of use with many generations
of babies. In Pilgrim Hall still may be seen
the quaint and finely wrought wicker cradle of Peregrine
White, the first white child born in Plymouth.
This cradle is of Dutch manufacture; and is one of
the few authentic articles still surviving that came
over on the <em>Mayflower</em>. It was brought over by
William White, whose widow married Governor
Edward Winslow. A similar wicker cradle may be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span>
seen at the Essex Institute in Salem, together with
a heavy wooden cradle in which many members of
the Townes family of Topsfield, Massachusetts,
were rocked to sleep two centuries ago. Judge
Sewall bought a wicker cradle for one of his many
children and paid sixteen shillings for it. A graceful
variant of the swinging cradle is shown in the
Indian basket hung at either end from a wooden
standard or frame. In this strong basket, fashioned
by an Indian mother, many a white child has been
swung and sung to sleep. A still more picturesque
cradle was made of birch bark, that plentiful
material so widely adaptive to household uses, and
so deftly manipulated and shaped by the patient
squaws.</p>

<p>In these cradles the colonial baby slept, warmly
wrapped in a homespun blanket or pressed quilt.</p>

<p><cite>Poor Robin's Almanack</cite> for the year 1676 enumerates
among a baby's outfit:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem">
<span class="i0">"Blanckets of a several scantling<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Therein for to wrap a bantling."<br /></span>
</div>

<p>Of these wraps, of the thinner sort, may be named
the thin, close-woven, homespun "flannel sheet,"
spun of the whitest wool into a fine twisted worsted,
and woven with a close sley into an even web as
enduring as the true Oriental cashmere. The baby's<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span>
initials were often marked on these sheets, and fortunate
was the child who had the light, warm wrappings.
My own children had "flannel sheets" that
had seen a century or more of use with generations
of forbears.</p>

</div>

<p>A finer coverlet, one of state, the christening<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span>
blanket, was usually made of silk, richly embroidered,
sometimes with a text of Scripture. These
were often lace-bordered or edged with a narrow
home-woven silk fringe. The christening blanket
of Governor Bradford of the Plymouth Colony still
exists, whole of fabric and unfaded of dye. It
is a rich crimson silk, soft of texture, like a
heavy sarcenet silk, and is powdered at regular
distances about six inches apart with conventional
sprays of flowers embroidered chiefly in pink and
yellow, in minute and beautiful cross-stitch. It is
distinctly Oriental in appearance, far more so than
is indicated by its black and white representation
here. Another beautiful silk christening blanket
was quilted in an intricate flower pattern in almost
imperceptible stitches. These formal wrappings of
state were sometimes called bearing-cloths or clothes,
and served through many generations. Shakespeare
speaks in <cite>Henry VI.</cite> of a child's bearing-cloth.</p>

<p>A go-cart or standing-stool was a favorite instrument
to teach a child to walk. A standing-stool a
century old in which Newburyport babies stood
and toddled is a rather crude frame of wood with
a ledge or narrow table for toys. The method
of using a go-cart is shown in this old print taken
from a child's book called, <cite>Little Prattle over a
Book of Prints</cite>, published for sixpence in 1801.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span>
In the writers of Queen Anne's day frequent references
are made to go-carts.</p>

<p>I find strong evidence that Locke's <cite>Thoughts
on Education</cite>, published in England in 1690, found
many readers and
ardent followers in
the new world. The
book is in many old-time
library lists in
New England, and
among the scant volumes
of those who
had but a single
book-shelf or book-box.
I have seen
abstracts and transpositions
of his precepts
on the pages
of almanacs, the most
universally circulated
and studied of all
eighteenth-century books save the Bible. In contemporary
letters evidence is found of the influence
of Locke's principles. In the prefaces of Thomas'
reprints he is quoted and eulogized. The notions
of the English philosopher appealed to American
parents because they were, as the author said, "the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span>
consideration not what a physician ought to do with
a sick or crazy child, but what parents without the
help of physic should do for the preservation of an
healthy constitution." Crazy here is used in the
old-time sense of feeble bodily health, not mental.
In these days of hundreds of books on child-study,
education, child-culture, and kindred topics, it is a
distinct pleasure to read Locke's sturdy sentences;
to see how wise, and kindly, and logical he was in
nearly all his advices, especially on moral or ethical
questions. Even those on physical conditions that
seem laughably obsolete to-day were so in advance
of the general practices of his day that they are
farther removed from the notions of his time than
from those of ours. In judging them let us
remember Dr. Holmes' lines:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem">
<span class="i0">"Little of all we value here<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Wakes on the morn of its hundredth year<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Without both looking and feeling queer."<br /></span>
</div>

<p>Certainly an existence of two centuries may make us
pardon a little queerness in advice.</p>

<p>One of Locke's instructions much thought on in
the years his book was so widely read was the advice
to wash the child's feet daily in cold water, and "to
have his shoes so thin that they might leak and let
in water." Josiah Quincy was the suffering subject
of some of this instruction; when only three years<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span>
old he was taken from his warm bed in winter as
well as summer (and this in Eastern Massachusetts),
carried downstairs to a cellar kitchen and dipped
three times in a tub of cold water fresh from the
pump. He was also brought up with utter indifference
to wet feet; he said that in his boyhood
he sat more than half the time with his feet wet and
cold, but with no ill results.</p>

<p>Locke also strongly counselled learning dancing,
swimming, and playing in the open air. In his diet
"flesh should be forborn as long as the boy is in
coats, or at least till he is two or three years old"; for
breakfast and supper he advises milk, milk-pottage,
water-gruel, flummery, and similar "spoon-meat,"
or brown bread with cheese. If the boy called for
victuals between meals, he should have dry bread.
His only extra drink should be small-beer, which
should be warm; and seldom he should taste wine
or strong drink. Locke would not have children
eat melons, peaches, plums, or grapes; while
berries and ripe pears and apples, the latter especially
after October, he deems healthful. The bed
should be hard, of quilts rather than of feathers.
Under these rigid rules were reared many of our
Revolutionary heroes and statesmen.</p>

</div>

<p>The adoption of Locke's ideas about the use of
cold water, or indeed of any frequent bathing,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span>
was perhaps the most radical innovation in modes
of living. The English never bathed, in our sense
of the word, a complete immersion, nor, I suppose,
did our Puritan, Cavalier, or Quaker ancestors.
Sewall makes not one reference to anything of the
kind, but that is not strange; nor is his omission
any proof, negative or positive, for he refers to no
personal habits, and very shortly and infrequently
to dress. Pepys, the courtier and dandy, tells of
rare monumental occasions when he cleaned himself&mdash;far
too rare, we may judge from side-lights thrown
by other of his statements. The <cite>Youth's Behavior</cite>,
an old-time book of etiquette, lays down
an assertion that it is a point of wholesomeness to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span>
wash one's face and hands as soon as one is up and
dressed, and "to comb one's head in time and season,
yet not too curiously." Bathing the person in
unaccustomed spots was a ticklish proceeding&mdash;a
water ordeal, to be gravely considered. Mistress
Alice Thornton, a Yorkshire dame, records in her
account of her life one occasion when she washed
her feet, but she was overbold. "Which my
mother did believe it was the cause of that dangerous
fitt the next day." In the Verney volumes we find
that forlorn Verney boy, poor sickly "Mun," wearing
a harness for his crooked back till his shirt was
black, when the famous surgeon changed the harness,
and Mun his shirt, with no thought on the
part of either of a bath being a necessity.</p>

<p>In 1630 a ship was sent from England to Massachusetts
which was provisioned for three months.
Among the stores for the passengers' use were two
casks of Malaga and Canary; twenty gallons of
aqua-vit&aelig;; forty-five tuns of beer; and for drinking,
washing, cooking, bathing, etc., but six tuns of
water. The ships sent out to Georgia by Oglethorpe
were so scantily supplied with water that it
is positive no fresh water could have been used for
bathing even in minute amount. The reputation
of hidden malevolence which hung around water as
a beverage seems to have extended to its use in any<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span>
form. It was believed to be permeated with minute
noxious particles, which in those ante-bacteriological
days could not be explained, but which were distinctly
appreciated and dreaded.</p>

<p>But these be parlous words. Let us rather show
some sympathy for our ancestors. We bathe in
well-warmed rooms, often in cold water, but with
steaming hot water in ample command at a turn of
the hand. Had we to carry all the water for our
bathing use from a well whence we laboriously raised
it in small amounts, and were we forced to bathe in
an icy atmosphere, with cutting draughts striking us
on every side, with the basins of water freezing on
the hearth in front of a blazing fire, and the juices
of the wood freezing at the ends of burning logs,
we might not deem our daily bath such an indispensable
necessity.</p>

<p>We have heard an advanced thinker like Locke
suggest brown bread, cheese, and warm beer as food
for young children. What, then, must have been
the notions of less thoughtful folk? Doubtless in
England such food would have been simple; but in
the new world less beer was drank and more milk,
which must have proved the salvation of American
children. And the plentiful and varied cereal foods,
many of them from Indian corn, were a suitable
diet for young children. Samp, hominy, suppawn,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span>
pone, succotash,&mdash;all Indian foods and cooked in
Indian ways,&mdash;were found in every home in every
colony. Baked beans, another Indian dish, were
also good food for children. Native and domestic
fruits were plentiful, but, with the exception of
apples and pears, were not very attractive. The
succession of summer's and autumn's berries must
have been eagerly welcomed. They were in the rich
and spicy plenty offered by a virgin soil.</p>

<p>A curious, rare, and quaintly named English
book is owned by Earl Spencer. Its title runs
thus:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"Dyves Pragmaticus. A booke in English metre of
the great marchuant man called Dyves Pragmaticus, very
pretye for chyldren to rede, whereby they may be the
better and more readyer rede and wryte Wares and Implements
in this World contayned.... When thou sellest
aught unto thy neighbour or byest anything of him deceave
not nor oppress him, etc. Imprinted at London in Aldersgate
strete by Alexander Lacy dwellynge beside the Wall.
The XXV of Aprill, 1563."</p></blockquote>

<p>It contains a list of sweetmeats for the enticement
of children which may be confidently relied on as a
full one if we can judge by the exhaustiveness of the
lists of other commodities found in the poem:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem">
<span class="i0">"I have Sucket, Surrip, Grene Ginger, and Marmalade,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Bisket, Cumfet, and Carraways as fine as can be made."<br /></span>
</div>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span>
A sucket was a dried sweetmeat such as candied
orange peel. A caraway was a sweet cake with
caraway-seeds.</p>

<p>Apples and caraways were a favorite dish, still
served at some of the anniversary feasts of English
universities. Comfits were highly flavored, often
scented with strong perfumes like musk and
bergamot.</p>

<p>Sweetmeats appear to have been plentiful in the
colonies from early days. The first native poet of
New England wrote complainingly as early as 1675
that&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem">
<span class="i0">"From western isles now fruits and delicacies<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Do rot maids' teeth and spoil their handsome faces."<br /></span>
</div>

<p>Ships in the "Indian trade" brought to the colonies
abundance of sugar, molasses, chocolate, ginger,
and other dried fruits. These were apparently far
more common here than in England; Mr. Ernst
says these constant relays of sweets "produced
the American sweet-tooth&mdash;a wonder." Candied
eringo-root, candied lemon-peel, angelica candy, as
well as caraway comfits and sugared coriander-seed
and dried ginger, were advertised for sale in Boston,
and show the taste of the day. In 1731 Widow
Bonyet had a notice of her specialties in the <cite>Boston
News Letter</cite>. It has quite the modern ring in its
meat jellies for the sick, and home-made preserves,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span>
jellies, and sirups. She also made those ancient
sweets, macaroons, marchpanes, and crisp almonds.
These latter do not appear to be the glazed and
burnt almonds of the confectioner, and may have
been salted almonds. The only candy Sewall refers
to is sugared almonds. He frequently speaks of gifts
of oranges, figs, and "raisins of the sun." Raisins
were brought into all the colonial ports in vast
amounts, and were until this century regarded by
children as a great dainty.</p>

<p>Each large city seems to have had some special
confectioner or baker who was renowned for
special cakes. Boston had Meer's cakes. New
York children probably had the greatest variety
of cookies, crullers, and various small cakes, as
these were distinctly Dutch, and the Dutch vrouws
excelled in cake-making.</p>

<p>Strings of rock-candy came from China, but were
rivalled by a distinctly native sweet&mdash;maple sugar.
Equally American appear to us those Salem sweets,
namely, Black Jacks and Salem Gibraltars. Base
imitations appeared elsewhere, but never equalled the
original delights in Salem. Children who were fortunate
enough to live in coast towns reaped the sweet
fruits of their fathers' foreign ventures. When a ship
came into port with eighty boxes of sugar candy on
board and sixty tubs of rock-candy, poor indeed was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span>
the child who was not surfeited with sweets. There
was a sequel, however, to the toothsome feast, a
bitter dessert. The ship that brought eighty
boxes of sugar candy also fetched
a hundred boxes of rhubarb
and ten of
senna.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER II</h2>

<h3>CHILDREN'S DRESS</h3>

<blockquote>

held up by Clothes.</em></p>

<p>Of the dress of infants of colonial times we
can judge from the articles of clothing
which have been preserved till this day.
Perhaps I should say that we can judge of the better
garments worn by babies, not their everyday dress;
for it is not their simpler attire that has survived,
but their christening robes, their finer shirts and
petticoats and caps.</p>

<p>Linen formed the chilling substructure of their
dress, thin linen, low-necked, short-sleeved shirts;
and linen even formed the underwear of infants
until the middle of this century. These little linen
shirts are daintier than the warmest silk or fine
woollen underwear that have succeeded them; they
are edged with fine narrow thread lace, hemstitched
with tiny rows of stitches, and sometimes embroidered<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span>
by hand. I have seen a little shirt and a cap
embroidered with the coat of arms of the Lux and
Johnson families and the motto, "God bless the
Babe;" these delicate garments were worn in infancy
by the Revolutionary soldier, Governor Johnson
of Virginia.</p>

<div class="caption"><p class="center">Baptismal Shirt and Mittens of Governor Bradford, 1590</p></div>
</div>

<p>In the Essex Institute in Salem, Massachusetts,
are the baptismal shirt and mittens of the Pilgrim
Father, William Bradford, second governor of the
Plymouth Colony, who was born in 1590. All are
of firm, close-woven, homespun linen, but the little
mittens have been worn at the ends by the active
friction of baby hands, and are patched with colored<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span>
"chiney" or calico. A similar colored material frills
the sleeves and neck. A pair of baby's mitts of
fine lace also may be seen at the Essex Institute.
These were wrought in the sixteenth century, and
the stitches and work are those of the antique
Flanders laces. I have seen many tiny mitts knit
of silk and mittens of fine linen, hemstitched, worked
in drawn work or embroidered, and edged with
thread-lace, and also a few mitts of yellow nankeen
which must have proved specially irritating to the
tiny little hands that wore them.</p>

<p>I have never seen a woollen petticoat that was
worn by an infant of pre-Revolutionary days. It
may be argued that woollen garments, being liable to
ruin by moths, would naturally not be treasured.
This argument scarcely is one of force, because I
have been shown infants' cloaks of wool as well as
woollen garments for older folk, that have been successfully
preserved; also beautifully embroidered
long cloaks of chamois skin. I think infants wore
no woollen petticoats; their shirts, petticoats, and
gowns were of linen or some cotton stuff like dimity.
Warmth of clothing was given by tiny shawls
pinned round the shoulders, and heavier blankets
and quilts and shawls in which baby and petticoats
were wholly enveloped.</p>

</div>

<p>The baby dresses of olden times are either rather<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span>
shapeless sacques drawn in at the neck with narrow
cotton ferret or linen bobbin, or little straight-waisted
gowns of state. All were exquisitely made by hand,
and usually of fine stuff. But the babies in pioneer
settlements a century ago had to share in wearing
homespun. It is told of one in a log cabin in a
New Hampshire clearing that when the grandmother
rode out eighty miles on horseback to see
her son's first baby, she shed bitter tears at beholding
the child, but a few months old, clad in a gray
woollen homespun slip with an apron or tier of
blue and white checked linen. The mother, a
frontier lass, dressed the infant according to the
fashions she was accustomed to.</p>

<p>Nothing could show so fully the costume of children
in olden times as their portraits, and a series
of such portraits of successive dates will be given in
these pages. Many of them are asserted to be by
the three well-known artists of colonial days,&mdash;Blackburn,
Smibert, and Copley; a few are by Peale,
Trumbull, and Stuart. I have accepted all family
traditions as true, and in many cases believe them
to be true, especially since there were few painters
of any rank in the community, and no others who
could paint portraits such as those which have been
preserved. The Gilbert Stuarts and Trumbulls
usually have some authentic pedigree. Many of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span>
these pictures have no artist's signature and are
absolutely valueless as works of art, and probably
meritless as likenesses; but as records of costume
they are always of interest and historical worth.</p>

<p>There is a certain sweetness in some of these old-time
portraits; they are stiff and flat, but some of
them have a quaintness that reminds me of the
angels of the early Florentine painters. They have
little grace of figure, but the details of costume make
them pleasing even if they are not beautiful.</p>

<p>The first child's portrait in this series is one of
extraordinary interest. It is opposite page 4, and
has never before been given to the public. It is the
reputed miniature of the Pilgrim Father, Governor
Edward Winslow, when a boy about six years of
age, which would be in 1602; it is the only miniature
in existence of any of the Pilgrims at any age. I
have, in deference to the wishes of the Rev. Dr.
William Copley Winslow of Boston (to whom I
am indebted for it), entitled it the reputed miniature
of the child Edward Winslow, though the term
expresses neither his belief nor mine; and seems
scarcely just to a portrait whose claims to authenticity
are far more definite than those of many of
the family portraits that have descended to us.</p>

<div class="figcenter bord" style="width: 400px;"><a name="mitts" id="mitts"></a>

<div class="caption"><p class="center">Infant's Mitts, 16th Century</p></div>
</div>

<p>The miniature came to Dr. Winslow from Mrs.
Hersey of Pembroke, Massachusetts. She died at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span>
the age of eighty-six. Her grandfather assured her
that his father (the famous General John Winslow)
received the likeness from his father (the grandson
of Edward the Pilgrim), and that it was the Pilgrim's
likeness as a child. This&mdash;through long-lived Winslows&mdash;is
a record of few retellings; and these
were told by folk to be trusted. The Winslows
were gentlefolk of ample means, such as were likely
to have miniatures painted; and the portrait of
Governor Winslow when fifty-six years of age, now
in Pilgrim Hall, Plymouth, is the sole one (save
this miniature) of any of the Pilgrims. Other<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span>
strong evidence is the extraordinary resemblance of
the child's picture to the "grown-up" portrait, the
same brow, contour of face, and other similarity.</p>

<p>There is something in the child's portrait that
is singularly suggestive to any one with any historical
imagination. The simplicity of the dress and
arrangement of the hair show the influence of Puritanism.
As I look at it I can fancy, yes, I can
plainly see, some little English children, twenty years
later standing on that crowded historic ship, looking
back with childish serenity at the home they were
leaving, and then greeting as cheerfully and trustingly
the "sad Plymouth" where they disembarked;
and the faces that I see have the broad brow, the
flowing hair, the bared neck, and simple dress shown
in this miniature.</p>

<p>The next portrait, which faces the title page,
shows the costume worn in 1690 by a boy a year or
two old; it is a charming and quaint picture of the
first John Quincy, who was born in 1689, and who
when dying, in 1767, gave his name to his great-grandson,
John Quincy Adams, who had just been
born. Some have thought the picture that of a
sister, Esther Quincy; but to me it has a hard little
boy's face, not the features of a delicate girl, and
also a boy's hands, and a boy's toy.</p>

<p>Children in America, if gentlefolk, dressed just<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span>
as children did in England at that date; and boys
wore "coats" in England till they were six or seven.
One of the most charming of all grandmothers'
letters was written by a doting English grandmother
to her son, Lord Chief Justice North, telling of the
"leaving off of coats" of his motherless little son,
Francis Guildford, then six years old. The letter
is dated October 10, 1679:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
"<span class="smcap">Dear Son</span>:
</p>

<p>"You cannot beleeve the great concerne that was
in the whole family here last Wednesday, it being the day
that the taylor was to helpe to dress little ffrank in his
breeches in order to the making an everyday suit by it.
Never had any bride that was to be drest upon her weding
night more handes about her, some the legs, some the armes,
the taylor butt'ning, and others putting on the sword, and
so many lookers on that had I not a ffinger amongst I could
not have seen him. When he was quite drest he acted his
part as well as any of them for he desired he might goe
downe to inquire for the little gentleman that was there
the day before in a black coat, and speak to the man to tell
the gentleman when he came from school that there was a
gallant with very fine clothes and a sword to have waited
upon him and would come again upon Sunday next. But
this was not all, there was great contrivings while he was
dressing who should have the first salute; but he sayd if
old Joan had been here, she should, but he gave it to me to
quiett them all. They were very fitt, everything, and he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span>
looks taller and prettyer than in his coats. Little Charles
rejoyced as much as he did for he jumpt all the while about
him and took notice of everything. I went to Bury, and
bo<sup>t</sup> everything for another suitt which will be finisht
on Saturday so the coats are to be quite left off on Sunday.
I consider it is not yett terme time and since you could not
have the pleasure of the first sight, I resolved you should
have a full relation from</p>

<p class="sig">
"Yo<sup>r</sup> most aff<sup>nate</sup> Mother<br />

"<span class="smcap">A North</span>.
</p>

<p>When he was drest he asked Buckle whether muffs
were out of fashion because they had not sent him one."</p></blockquote>

<p>This affectionate letter, written to a great and
busy statesman, the Lord Keeper of the Seals,
shows how pure and delightful domestic life in England
could be; but the writer was not a commonplace
woman&mdash;she was the mother of fourteen
children, and had had years of experience with a
father-in-law before whom an army of traditional
mothers-in-law would pale. She lived through this
ordeal and a trying marital experience, and her
children rose up and called her blessed. Among
her virtues her son Roger dilated at length upon her
delightful letter-writing, her "freedom of style and
matter," and declared that her letters were among
the comforts of her children's lives.</p>

<p>To return to the dress of John Quincy: with the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span>
exception of the neck of the body of the frock it is
much like the dress of grown women of that day.
We have existing portraits of Madam Shimpton and
Rebecca Rawson of the same date. In both of these,
as in this little boy's portrait, the sleeve is the
most noticeable feature, with its single slash, double
puff drawn in below the elbow and confined with
pretty ribbon knots. This sleeve was known as the
virago sleeve, and John Quincy's are darker colored
than his frock. All three wear loosely tied rather
shapeless hoods, such as are seen on the women in
the prints of the coronation procession of King
William. The boy has a close cap under his hood.
His dress is certainly picturesque and distinctive.</p>

<p>A portrait, facing page 36, of another Massachusetts
boy, contemporary with John Quincy, is that
of Robert Gibbs, the rich Boston merchant. This
is plainly marked as being painted when he was
four and a half years old, and with the date 1670.
He wears the same stiff cuirass as John Quincy, the
same odd truncated shoes of buff leather, and has
the same masculine swing of the petticoats. Both
figures stand on a checker-board floor, four squares
deep, with their toes at the same point on the board.
Robert Gibbs wears a more boyish collar, or band,
as befits a bigger boy. The sleeves are an important
feature of his dress, having a pair of long<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span>
hanging sleeves bordered with fur, which do not
show in the print in this book, but are plainly
visible in the original portrait. Hanging sleeves
were so distinctively the dress of a little child that
the term had at that time a symbolic significance,
implying childishness both of youth and second
childhood. Pepys thus figuratively employs the
term. Judge Sewall wrote in old age to a brother
whose widowed sister he desired to marry:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"I remember when I was going from school at Newbury
to have sometime met your sisters Martha and Mary
in Hanging Sleeves, coming home from their school in
Chandlers Lane, and have had the pleasure of speaking to
them. And I could find it in my heart now to speak to
Mrs Martha again, now I myself am reduc'd to Hanging
Sleeves."</p></blockquote>

<p>This roundabout wooing came to naught. The
Judge married Widow Mary Gibbs, relict of this
very Robert Gibbs whose childish portrait we have
here. The artist who painted this picture may
have been Tom Child, who is named by Judge
Sewall as the portrait-painter of that day.</p>

<p>A demure and quaint portrait, opposite page 42,
is that of Jane Bonner. She was born in 1691, the
daughter of Captain John Bonner of Boston, and
was married in 1710 to John Ellery. She was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span>
about eight or ten years old when the portrait was
painted. Crude as is the painting, it gives evident
proof that the lace of the stomacher and sleeve frills
is of the nature of what is now called rose point.</p>

<p>In the early settlements of Connecticut, Massachusetts,
and Virginia, sumptuary laws were passed to
restrain and attempt to prohibit extravagance in
dress. The New England magistrates were curiously
minute in description of overluxurious attire,
and many offenders were tried and fined. But vain
daughters and sons "psisted in fflonting," though
ministers joined the lawmakers in solemn warnings
and reprehensions. Young girls were fined for silk
hoods and immoderate great sleeves, and boldly appeared
in court in still richer attire. The Dutch
never attempted or wished to simplify the dress
of either men or women. In New York dress was
ample, substantial, varied in texture, and variegated
in color. It ever formed a considerable item in personal
property. The children of the Dutch settlers
had plentiful and warm clothing, and sometimes very
rich clothing, as may be seen in the quaint and interesting
picture facing page 26, of twin girls, the two
daughters of Abraham De Peyster of New York,
and his wife, Margaret Van Cortlandt. They are
dressed in red velvet trained gowns, but are barefooted.
They were born December 3, 1724, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span>
Eva died in 1729, a
month after the portrait
was painted.
Catherine was married
on her eighteenth
birthday to John Livingstone,
son of the
second lord of the
manor. Their son
had a daughter
Catherine, who became
the wife of Don
Mariano Velasquez
de la Cadenas. To
their daughters, Mrs.
Azoy and Miss Mariana
Velasquez, this
interesting portrait
now belongs.</p>

<div class="caption"><p class="center">Infant's Robe, Cap and Christening Blanket</p></div>

<p>The mother of
these twins was the
daughter of Jacobus
Van Cortlandt and
Eva De Vries Philipse. The names of Eva and
Catherine have ever been given to the little daughters
of these allied families, and are borne to-day
by many of their descendants.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span></p>

<p>Another little girl of Dutch blood was Cathalina
Post, who married Zegor Van Santvoord. Her portrait
was painted in 1750 when she was fourteen years
old, and is now owned by Dr. Van Santvoord of
Kingston-on-Hudson, New York. A copy of this
quaint old picture faces page 204. It is most interesting
in costume; the head-gear showing distinct
Dutch influence.</p>

<p>There is a suggestion of earrings in this portrait, and
Katherine Ten Broeck, another child of Dutch blood,
but three years old, wears earrings. The reproduction
of her portrait, given opposite page 192, shows these
jewels but dimly, but they are visible in the original
oil-painting. She was born in Albany in 1715.
The portrait is marked &AElig;tat<sup>s</sup> Sua, 3 Years, 1719.
She was married to John Livingstone, and lived to
become a stately old dame, receiving formally on
New Year's Day her grandchildren, who always
greeted her in Dutch learned for the special occasion.</p>

<p>The devastations of two wars (and in some localities
three)&mdash;destruction by fire and earthquake&mdash;have
sadly destroyed the cherished relics of many southern
homes. From Mrs. St. Julian Ravenel of Charleston,
South Carolina, the delightful biographer of
that delightful colonial dame, Eliza Lucas Pinckney,
come two portraits of children of the
Huguenot settlers. The picture facing page 48 of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span>
Ellinor Cordes of St. John's, Berkeley County,
South Carolina, painted about 1740, shows a lovely
little child of French features, and French daintiness
of dress, albeit a bright yellow brocaded satin
would seem rather gorgeous attire for a girl but two
years old. Opposite page 50 is a picture of Daniel
Ravenel of Wantoot, St. John's, Berkeley County,
South Carolina, who was born in 1760, and was
about five years old when this portrait was painted;
though he still wears what might be termed a frock
with petticoats, there is a decided boyishness in the
waistcoat with its silver buttons and lace, and the
befrogged overcoat with broad cuffs and wrist ruffles,
and a turned-over revers, and narrow linen
inner collar. It is an exceptionally pleasing boy's
dress for a little child.</p>

<p>Two portraits of Flagg children painted, it is
said, by Smibert, must be among his latest portraits,
for the baby, Polly Flagg, was born in Boston
in 1750, and Smibert died in 1751. The portrait
facing page 184 shows, as may be seen, a dear little
baby not a year old, in baby dress and cap, clasping
a toy. It is marked on the back Mrs. Polly
Hurd; for the little girl lived to be the wife and
widow of Dr. Wilder of Lancaster, Massachusetts,
and of Dr. Hurd of Concord, Massachusetts. Of
equal interest is the severely beautiful face of James<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span>
Flagg, her brother, shown opposite page 188. He
was born in 1739, and was still "coats" when this
portrait was painted. These portraits are owned by
Mrs. Albert Thorndike of Boston, Massachusetts,
the great-granddaughter of Griselda Apthorpe Flagg,
the sister of these two children.</p>

<p>The portrait of Jonathan Mountfort, given opposite
page 58, has a special interest to the art student,
since it is a specimen of Copley's early work.
The boy was born December 6, 1746, and was
seven years old when the portrait was painted. He
married Mary Bole, a Newfoundland girl, whose
father sent her to a school in Halifax, under the
charge of Captain Shepherd of Medford, Massachusetts.
Finding Halifax in a state of blockade,
the captain took the little girl to Boston. He and
his wife were childless and became deeply attached
to her and finally adopted her. She became engaged
to Dr. Mountfort, and went to visit her
parents in Ireland, whither they had removed.
On her return, bringing with her the gifts, wardrobe,
and household furnishings of a bride of that
period, she came into Boston harbor only to be
wrecked in sight of the town. The ship's mate
swam with her to the lighthouse, and the two were
the only ones saved. Captain Shepherd gave her a
house and fresh outfit, and she married Dr. Mountfort.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span>
They had seven children, but the name of
Mountfort is now extinct. Their daughter Elizabeth
married Major Thomas Pitts, whose daughter
is now Mrs. Farlin of Detroit, Michigan, the
present owner of this interesting portrait.</p>

<p>An altogether charming group of children, facing
page 54, two sisters and two brothers of Governor
Christopher Gore (seventh governor of Massachusetts),
was painted about the year 1754, by Copley.
The mature little girl of this picture, Frances, married
Thomas Crafts, colonel of the regiment of which
Paul Revere was lieutenant-colonel in the Revolution.
Colonel and Mrs. Crafts were the great-grandparents
of the present owners, Miss Julia
G. Robins and Miss Susan P. B. Robins. This
picture was for a time in the Boston Museum of
Art, and on returning it General Loring wrote,
"I shall miss the little grown-ups&mdash;were there no
children in those days?" This look of maturity
seems universal to all these portraits. I have photographs
of several other groups of children, one
of the most charming, that of the Grymes children,
now in the Capitol at Richmond, Virginia;
but they are all too darkened with age to admit of
proper or adequate reproduction, and must be left
out of these pages. The baby in the Grymes group
is truly a baby, not a "grown-up."</p>

<p>The handsomest of all the boy-portraits of colonial
days is that of Samuel Pemberton, by Blackburn;
it is perfect in feature and expression; though
he is but twelve years old he wears a wig. It was
painted in 1736, and boys of good family then wore
costly wigs. Mr. Freeman of Portland, Maine, had
in his book of expenses of the year 1750, such items
as these:&mdash;</p>

<p>The three sons&mdash;Samuel, James, and William&mdash;were
aged eleven, nine, and seven years. The shaving<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span>
was of their heads. Slaves of fashion were
parents of that day to bedeck their boys with such
rich wigs.</p>

<p>A more exquisite portrait than that of Thomas
Aston Coffin, opposite page 222, can scarcely be
found. It is painted in Copley's best manner
(shown in the highest perfection in the portrait of
his daughter Elizabeth). A light-hued satin petticoat-front
shows under a rich full-skirted satin over-dress
which brushes the ground. The pretty satin
sleeves have white under-sleeves and wrist ruffles,
but the neck is cut very low and round. The child
holds two pigeons by a leash, and a feathered hat is
by his side. This portrait was much loved by its
late owner, Miss Anne S. Robbins of Boston.</p>

<p>This charming picture of the Pepperell children,
facing page 214, was believed to be by Copley, and
included in Mr. Perkins' list. At present this
authorship is doubted. It is owned by Miss Alice
Longfellow of Cambridge, having been bought by
her father, the poet, from the owner of the Portsmouth
Museum, who had in some singular way
acquired it. The children are William, son of the
second Sir William Pepperell, and his sister Elizabeth
Royal Pepperell, who married Rev. Henry Hutton.</p>

<p>A bright-eyed little girl, Mary Lord, has her
portrait, given opposite page 66, hanging in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span>
rooms of the Connecticut Historical Society. She
was born in 1702, in Hartford, Connecticut, and
married, in 1724, Colonel Joseph Pitkin of Hartford.
By her side hangs the picture of Colonel
Wadsworth and his son, shown opposite page 316.
It is the one which the artist Trumbull took to Sir
Joshua Reynolds for advice and comment. He was
snubbed with the snappish criticism that "the coat
looked like bent tin." Other criticism might be
made on the anatomical proportions of the subjects.</p>

<p>Copley's genius is shown in the fine portrait of
William Verstile, facing page 210, painted in 1769.
There is one little glimpse of this boy's boyhood
which has so human an element, is so fully in touch
with modern life, that I give it. It is from an old
letter written by his mother, during a visit in Boston,
where possibly this very portrait was painted. It
shows the beginning of tastes which found ample
scope in his services in the war of the Revolution.</p>

<blockquote>

<p class="sig">
"<span class="smcap">Boston</span>, June 11, 1766.
</p>

<p>My Dear these leaves me and my friends as I hope
they will find you for health. I was obliged to stay a
fortnight as I didn't set out till the middle of the week
from Weathersfield, was obliged to tarry here a fortnight
on account of coming with the Post. We got down safe
we got into Boston Wednesday afternoon at four o Clock.
The Horse seem'd to enter Boston as free &amp; fresh as when<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span>
he first set out from home. Mr. Lowder says he is a
prime horse. He wasn't galled or fretted in the least but
would have come right back again. I was a good deal
worried as Billey didn't fill the chaise no more, the horse
might have brought three as well as two &amp; not have felt it.
I have had but very little Comfort since I have bin here on
account of Billey as there's so much powderwork going on
among the Children since the Illumination Billey has bin
very forward of firing iron guns. Since we've bin here its
not only the powder amongst the Children but the wharfes
being so neare he's down there continually. Johnny Bradford
&amp; Ned &amp; Dan Warner and Billey was down the
wharfe together when a boy push'd Dan over &amp; lik'd to
bin drown'd &amp; might bin Billey so I can't take much comfort
on leaving of him but shall bring him, you needn't be
Concern'd about threes coming up as Mr. Hide tells me
Billey may ride behind him if he's a mind to."</p></blockquote>

<p>Billey became a portrait painter himself, and got
four guineas apiece for his miniatures. He early
showed artistic predilections, and these tastes were
well supplied. Interspersed with pumps and hose
and hats for Billey are found in his father's purchases
"brass deviders," scales, "books for limning," two
dozen "hair pencils," and "1 box painter's collurs
on glass," which cost twelve shillings.</p>

<div class="caption"><p class="center">Gore Children, 1754</p></div>
</div>

<p>I don't know who taught Billey limning. There
was a funny book in circulation among students in
that day. It was written in serious intent, but its<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span>
rules read as though they were dictated by Oliver
Herford. It was entitled <cite>Every Young Man's Companion
in Drawing</cite>. Here are a few of its instructions
to young artists:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"Make your outlines, which may be mended occasionally.</p>

<p>"From the Elbow to the Root of the Little Finger is Two Noses.</p>

<p>"The Thumb contains a Nose.</p>

<p>"The Inside of Arm to Middle of Arm is Four Noses."</p></blockquote>

<p>The crowning glory of the Copley portraits is the
charming family group opposite page 180, depicting
Copley himself, his beautiful wife, his dignified
father-in-law, and his lovely children. It is now
exhibited in the Boston Museum of Fine Arts.
This group seems perfect, and the quaint figure
of the child Elizabeth Copley, in the foreground,
is worthy the brush of Van Dyck.</p>

<p>Colonel John Lewis, one of the old Virginia
gentlemen, had two child wards. As befitted young
gentlefolk of that day of opulence and extravagance,
they had their dress from England. In 1736, when
Robert Carter, the younger child, was about nine
years old, suits of fine holland, laced, and of red
worsted and of green German serge came across
seas for him, with laced hats with loops and buttons.
When he was twelve years old part of his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span>
"winter cloathes" were six pair of shoes and two
of pumps, four pair of worked hose and four of
thread hose, gloves, hats, and shoe buckles. His
sister Betty had a truly fashionable wardrobe, and
the stiff, restrictive dress of the times was indicated
by the items of stays, hoops, masks, and fans.
When "Miss Custis" was but four years old
George Washington ordered for her from England
packthread stays, stiffened coats, a large number of
gloves and masks.</p>

<p>An order for purchases sent to a London agent by
Washington in 1761 contains a full list of garments
for both his step-children. "Miss Custis" was
then six years old. These are some of the items:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"1 Coat made of Fashionable Silk.</p>

<p>A Fashionable Cap or fillet with Bib apron.</p>

<p>Ruffles and Tuckers, to be laced.</p>

<p>4 Fashionable Dresses made of Long Lawn.</p>

<p>2 Fine Cambrick Frocks.</p>

<p>A Satin Capuchin, hat, and neckatees.</p>

<p>A Persian Quilted Coat.</p>

<p>1 p. Pack Thread Stays.</p>

<p>4 p. Callimanco Shoes.</p>

<p>6 p. Leather Shoes.</p>

<p>2 p. Satin Shoes with flat ties.</p>

<p>6 p. Fine Cotton Stockings.</p>

<p>4 p. White Worsted Stockings.</p>

<p>12 p. Mitts.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span></p>

<p>6 p. White Kid Gloves.</p>

<p>1 p. Silver Shoe Buckles.</p>

<p>1 p. Neat Sleeve Buttons.</p>

<p>6 Handsome Egrettes Different Sorts.</p>

<p>6 Yards Ribbon for Egrettes.</p>

<p>12 Yards Coarse Green Callimanco."</p></blockquote>

<p>There is a large-headed portrait of the Custis
children which was painted at about this time. A
copy of it is shown opposite page 250. While the
dress of both children is mature, it is not so elegant
as might be expected from the rich garments which
were imported for them.</p>

<p>Sir William Pepperell ordered, in 1737, equally
costly and formal clothing from England for his
little daughter to disport at Piscataquay. Stays and
masks are ever on the lists of little gentlewomen.
A letter of the day tells of seeing the youthful
daughter of Governor Tryon sitting stiffly in a
chair, in broad lace collar, with heavy dress, never
playing, running, or even walking.</p>

<p>Delicacy of figure and whiteness of complexion
were equal fetiches with colonial mammas. Little
Dolly Payne, afterward Dolly Madison, wore long
gloves, a linen mask, and had a sunbonnet sewed
on her head every morning by her devoted mother.
Very thin shoes of silk, morocco, or light stuff unfitted
little girls for any very active exercise; these<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span>
were high-heeled. A tiny pair of shoes for a little
girl of three are shown on page 51. I have seen
children's stays, made of heavy strips of board and
steel, tightly wrought with heavy buckram or canvas
into an iron frame like an instrument of torture.
These had been worn by a little girl five years old.
Staymakers advertised stays, jumps, gazzets, costrells,
and caushets (which were doubtless corsets)
for ladies and children, "to make them appear
strait." And I have been told of tin corsets for
little girls, but I have never seen any such abominations.
One pair of stays was labelled as having
been worn by a boy when five years old.
There certainly is a suspicious suggestion in some
of these little fellows' portraits of whalebone and
buckram.</p>

<p>In the sprightly descriptions given by Anna Green
Winslow of her own dress we see with much distinctness
the little girl of twelve of the year 1771:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"I was dress'd in my yellow coat, my black bib &amp;
apron, my pompedore shoes, the cap my aunt Storer sometime
since presented me with blue ribbins on it, a very
handsome loket in the shape of a hart, the paste pin my
Hon'<sup>d</sup> Papa presented me with in my cap, my new cloak
&amp; bonnet on, my pompedore gloves, and I would tell you
they all lik'd my dress very much."... "I was dress'd in
my yellow coat, black bib and apron, black feathers on my<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span>
head, my paste comb, all my paste, garnet, marquasett, and
jet pins, together with my silver plume,&mdash;my loket rings,
black coller round my neck, black mitts, 2 or 3 yards of
blue ribbin, striped tucker &amp; ruffels &amp; my silk shoes compleated
my dress."</p></blockquote>

<div class="caption"><p class="center">Jonathan Mountfort, Seven Years Old, 1753</p></div>
</div>

<p>It would seem somewhat puzzling to fancy how,
with a little girl's soft hair, the astonishing and
varied head-gear named above could be attached.
Little Anna gives a full description of the way her
hair was dressed over a high roll, so heavy and hot
that it made her head "itch &amp; ach &amp; burn like
anything." She tells of the height of her head-gear:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"When it first came home, Aunt put it on &amp; my
new cap on it; she then took up her apron &amp; measur'd
me, &amp; from the roots of my hair on my forehead to the
top of my notions, I measur'd above an inch longer than
I did downwards from the roots of my hair to the end
of my chin."</p></blockquote>

<p>Her picture, shown facing page 164, is taken from
a miniature painted when she was a few years older.
The roll is more modest in size, and the decorations
are fewer in number. Each year the "head-equipage"
diminished, till cropped heads were seen, with
a shock of tight curls on the forehead&mdash;an incredibly
disfiguring mode.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span></p>

<p>In the chapter upon the school life of girls a letter
is given describing the dress of two young girls who
were boarding in Boston while they were being
taught. There is no doubt that very rich dress was
desired, and possibly required of these young scholar-boarders.
The oft-quoted letter in regard to Miss
Huntington's wardrobe shows the elegance of dress
of those schoolgirls. She had twelve silk gowns;
but word was sent home to Norwich that a recently
imported rich fabric was most suitable for her rank
and station; and in answer to the teacher's request
the parents ordered the purchase of this elegant
dress.</p>

<p>When cotton fabrics from Oriental countries became
everywhere and every time worn, children's dress,
as likewise that of grown folk, was much reduced in
elegance as it was in warmth. Hoops disappeared
and heavy petticoats also; the soft slimsy clinging
stuffs, suitable only for summer wear, were not discarded
in winter. Boys wore nankeen suits the entire
year. Calico and chintz were fashioned into
trousers and jackets. A little suit is shown, facing
page 60, made of figured calico of high colors,
which it is stated was worn in 1784. The labels are
very exact and the labellers very cautious of the
Deerfield Memorial Hall collection, else I should
assign this suit to a ten or even twenty years' later<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span>
date. Children must have suffered sadly with the
cold in this age of cotton. Girls' dresses were half
low-necked, and were filled in with a thin tucker;
separate sleeves were tied in at the arm size, and
often long-armed mitts of nankeen or linen took
the place of the sleeves.</p>

<p>A family of Cary children had several charming
portraits painted in London. Two of them are
given opposite pages 240 and 246. They note the
transitions of costume which came at the approach of
the close of the century. The portrait of the boy is
interesting in a special point of costume; it shows the
abandonment of the cocked hat and adoption of the
simpler modern form of head-covering. The little
girl, Margaret, has a most roguish expression, which
is suggestive of Sir Joshua Reynolds' <cite>Girl with
the Mouse Trap</cite>. The resemblance is even more
marked in the portrait of the same child at the age
of six, wherein the eyes and half-smile are charmingly
engaging; unfortunately the photograph from
that portrait is not clear enough for satisfactory
reproduction.</p>

<p>A demure little brother and sister were the children
of General Stephen Rowe Bradley of Westminster,
Vermont, whose portraits face pages 356 and
378. These were painted soon after the Revolution,
and show the definite changes in dress which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span>
set in with other Republican institutions. At
this date there began to be worn a special dress
for both boys and girls. Until then, as soon as a
boy put on breeches he dressed precisely like his
father&mdash;in miniature. By tradition Marie Antoinette
was the first who had a special dress made
for her young son. And sadly was she reviled for
dressing her poor little Dauphin in jacket
and trousers instead of flapped
coat, waistcoat, and
knee-breeches.</p>

<p>No greater contrast of conditions could exist
than between the school life of what we
love to call the "good old times," and that
of the far better times of to-day. Poor, small, and
uncomfortable schoolhouses, scant furnishings, few
and uninteresting books, tiresome and indifferent
methods of teaching, great severity of discipline,
were the accompaniments of school days until this
century. Yet with all these disadvantages children
obtained an education, for an education was warmly
desired; no difficulties could chill that deep-lying<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span>
longing for learning. "Child," said one noble
New England mother of the olden days, "if God
make thee a good Christian and a good scholar,
'tis all thy mother ever asked for thee."</p>

<p>Not only did parents strive for the education of
their children, but the colonies assisted by commanding
the building and maintaining of a school in each
town where there was a sufficient number of families
and scholars. Rhode Island was the only New
England colony that did not compel the building
of schoolhouses and the education of children.</p>

<p>So determined was Massachusetts to have schools
that in 1636, only six years after the settlement of
Boston, the General Court, which was composed of
representatives from every settlement in the Bay
Colony, and which was the same as our House of
Representatives to-day, gave over half the annual
income of the entire colony to establish the school
which two years later became Harvard College.
This event should be remembered; it is distinguished
in history as the first time any body of
people in any country ever gave through its representatives
its own money to found a place of
education.</p>

<p>In Virginia schoolhouses were few for over a century.
Governor Berkeley, an obstinate and narrow-minded
Englishman, wrote home to England in 1670,</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span></p>

<p>"I thank God there are in Virginia no free schools
nor printing, and I hope we shall not have, for learning
hath brought disobedience and heresy into the
world." Some Virginia gentlemen did not agree
with him, however, and gave money to try to establish
free schools for poor children. A far greater
hindrance to the establishment of schools than the
governor's stupid opposition, was the fact that there
was no town or village life in Virginia; the houses
and plantations were scattered; previous to the year
1700 Jamestown was the only Virginia town, and
it was but a petty settlement. Williamsburg was
not even laid out; a few seaports had been planned,
but had not been built. Hence the children of
wealthy planters were taught by private tutors at
home, or were sent to school in England.</p>

<p>Occasionally, as years passed on, there might be
found in Virginia, the Carolinas, and Georgia, what
was called an old-field school, the uniting of a few
neighbors to hire a teacher, too often a poor
one, like the "hedge-teachers" of Europe, for a
short term of teaching, in a shabby building placed
on an old exhausted tobacco field.</p>

<p>In one of these old-field schools kept by Hobby&mdash;sexton,
pedagogue, and "the most conceited man in
three parishes"&mdash;George Washington obtained most
of his education. A daily ride on horseback for a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span>
year to a similar school ten miles away, and for
another year a row morning and night even in
roughest weather across the river to a Fredericksburg
teacher, ended his school career when he was
thirteen; but he had then made a big pile of neatly
written manuscript school books, which may now
be seen in the Library at Washington; and he had
acquired a passionate longing to be educated, which
accompanied him through life.</p>

<p>An "advisive narrative" sent from America to
the Bishop of London, toward the end of the
seventeenth century, says:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"This lack of schools in Virginia is a consequence of
their scattered planting. It renders a very numerous generation
of Christian's Children born in Virginia, who naturally
are of beautiful and comely Persons, and generally of
more ingenious Spirits than those in England, unserviceable
for any great Employment in Church or State."</p></blockquote>

<div class="caption"><p class="center">Mary Lord, 1710 <em>circa</em></p></div>
</div>

<p>This statement was not wholly correct; for though
Virginians were not usually fitted to be parsons, they
certainly proved suited to state and government.
When the war of the Revolution broke out, the
noblest number of great statesmen, orators, and
generals, who certainly were men of genius if not
of conventional school education, came from the
southern provinces. These brilliant Virginians were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span>
strong evidence and proof of what the great orator,
Patrick Henry, called, in his singular pronunciation,
"naiteral pairts"; which he declared was of more
account than "all the book-lairnin' on the airth."
Different climates and surroundings soon bring out
different traits in the same race of people. The
warm climate and fruitful soil in the southern colonies
developed from English stock an easy-living
race who needed the great stimulus and noble excitement
of the Revolution to exhibit the highest
qualities of brain. The Puritan minister, Cotton
Mather, said in 1685, in a sermon before the Governor
and Council in Massachusetts, "The Youth
in this Country are verie Sharp and early Ripe in
their Capacities." Thus speedily had keen New
England air and hard New England life developed
these characteristic New England traits.</p>

<p>New England at that time was controlled, both
in public and private life, by the Puritan ministers,
who felt, as one of them said, that "unless school
and college flourish, church and state cannot live."
The ministers were accredited guardians of the
schools; and when Boston chose five school inspectors
to visit the Latin School with the ministers,
many of the latter were highly incensed, and Increase
Mather refused to go with these lay visitors.</p>

<p>By a law of Massachusetts, passed in 1647, it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span>
was ordered that every town of fifty families should
provide a school where children could be taught to
read and write; while every town of one hundred
householders was required to have a grammar school.
In the Connecticut Code of Laws of 1650 were the
same orders. These schools were public, but were
not free; they were supported at the expense of the
parents.</p>

<p>In 1644 the town of Salem ordered "that a note
be published the next lecture day, that such as have
children to be kept at school, would bring in their
names, and what they will give for a whole year;
and also that if any poor body hath children or a
child to be put to school, and not able to pay for
their schooling, that the town will pay it by a rate."
Lists of children were made out in towns, and if the
parents were well-to-do, they had to pay whether
their children attended school or not.</p>

<p>Land was sometimes set aside to support partly
the school; it was called the "school-meadows,"
or "school-fields," and was let out for an income to
help to pay the teacher. This was a grant made on
the same principle that grants were made to physicians,
tanners, and other useful persons, not to establish
free education. At a later date lotteries were
a favorite method of raising money for schools.</p>

<p>It was not until about the time of the Revolution<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span>
that the modern signification of the word "free"&mdash;a
school paid for entirely by general town taxes&mdash;could
be applied to the public schools of most
Massachusetts towns, and when the schools of Boston
were made free, that community stood alone
for its liberality not only in America, but in the
world.</p>

<p>The pay was given in any of the inconvenient
exchanges which had to pass as money at that time,&mdash;in
wampum, beaver skins, Indian corn, wheat, peas,
beans, or any country product known as "truck."
It is told of a Salem school, that one scholar was
always seated at the window to study and also to hail
passers-by, and endeavor to sell to them the accumulation
of corn, vegetables, etc., which had been given
in payment to the teacher.</p>

<p>The logs for the great fireplace were furnished by
the parents or guardians of the scholars as a part
of the pay for schooling; and an important part
it was in the northern colonies, in the bitter winter,
in the poorly built schoolhouses. Some schoolmasters,
indignant at the carelessness of parents
who failed to send the expected load of wood
early in the winter, banished the unfortunate child
of the tardy parent to the coldest corner of the
schoolroom. The town of Windsor, Connecticut,
voted "that the committee be empowered to exclude<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span>
any scholar that shall not carry his share of wood
for the use of the said school." In 1736 West
Hartford ordered every child "barred from the
fire" whose parents had not sent wood.</p>

</div>

<p>The school laws of the State of Massachusetts,
framed in 1789, crystallized all the principles, practice,
and hopes that had been developed by a hundred
and fifty years of school life. The standard set
by these laws was decidedly lower than those of
colonial days. Where a permanent English school
had been imperative, six months schooling a year
might be permitted to take its place; where every
town of a hundred families had had a grammar
school in which boys could be fitted for the university,
only towns of two hundred families were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a></span>
compelled to have such schools. Thus the open
path to the university was closed in a hundred and
twenty Massachusetts towns.</p>

<p>Judge Thomas Holme composed in grammarless
rhyme, in 1696, a <cite>True Relation of the Flourishing
State of Philadelphia</cite>. In it he says:&mdash;</p>

<p>These statements were scarcely carried out in
fact; in Pennsylvania educational advantages were
few, and among some classes education was sorely
hampered. The Quakers did not encourage absolute
illiteracy, but they thought knowledge of the
"three R's" was enough; they distinctly disapproved
of any extended scholarship, as it fostered
undue pride and provoked idleness. The Germans
were worse; their own historians, the Calvinist and
Lutheran preachers, Schlatter and Muhlenberg, are
authority; there were among them a few schools of
low grade; but the introduction of the public
school system among the Germans was resisted by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span>
indignation meetings and litigation. The Tunkers
degenerated so that they did not desire a membership
of educated persons, and would have liked to
destroy all books but religious ones. It was said
by these German settlers that schooling made boys
lazy and dissatisfied on the farms, and that religion
would suffer by too much learning. As Bayard
Taylor puts it in his <cite>Pennsylvania Farmer</cite>:&mdash;</p>

<p>School-teachers in the middle and southern colonies
were frequently found in degraded circumstances;
many of them were redemptioners and
exported convicts. I have frequently noted such
newspaper advertisements as this from the <cite>Maryland
Gazette</cite>:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"Ran away: A Servant man who followed the occupation
of a Schoolmaster, much given to drinking and
gambling."</p></blockquote>

<p>So universal was drunkenness among schoolmasters
that a chorus of colonial "gerund-grinders"
might sing in Goldsmith's words:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem">

<p>Scotland furnished the best and the largest number
of schoolmasters to the colonies.</p>

<p>The first pedagogue of New Amsterdam was one<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span>
Adam Roelantsen, and he had a checkered career.
His name appears with frequency on the court
records of the little town both as plaintiff and defendant.
He was as active in slandering his neighbors
as they were in slandering him; though, as
Miss Van Vechten observes, "It is hard to see
what fiction worse than truth could have been
invented about him." In spite of the fact that
"people did not speak well of him," he married
well. But his misdemeanors continued and he was
finally sentenced to be flogged. We may contrast
the legal records of this gentleman's shortcomings
with his duties as set forth in his commission, one
of which was "to set others a good example as
becometh a devout, pious, and worthy consoler of
the sick, church clerk, precentor, and schoolmaster."</p>

<p>Some of the contracts under which teachers were
hired still exist. One for the teacher at the Dutch
settlement of Flatbush, Long Island, in 1682, is very
full in detail, and we learn much of the old-time
school from it. A bell was rung to call the scholars
together at eight o'clock in the morning, the school
closed for a recess at eleven, opened again at one,
closed at four; all sessions began and closed with
prayer. On Wednesdays and Saturdays the children
were taught the questions and answers in the catechism
and the common prayers. The master was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a></span>
paid (usually in wheat or corn) for "a speller or
reader" three guilders a quarter, for "a writer" four
guilders. He had many other duties to perform
besides teaching the children. He rung the church
bell on Sunday, read the Bible at service in church,
and led in the singing; sometimes he read the sermon.
He provided water for baptisms, bread and
wine for communion, and in fact performed all the
duties now done by a sexton, including sweeping
out the church. He delivered invitations to funerals
and carried messages. Sometimes he dug the graves,
and often he visited and comforted the sick.</p>

<p>Full descriptions exist of the first country schoolhouses
in Pennsylvania and New York. They
were universally made of logs. Some had a rough
puncheon floor, others a dirt floor which readily
ground into dust two or three inches thick, that
unruly pupils would purposely stir up in clouds to
annoy the masters and disturb the school. The
bark roof was a little higher at one side that
the rain might drain off. Usually the teacher sat
in the middle of the room, and pegs were thrust
between the logs around the walls, three or four feet
from the ground; boards were laid on these pegs;
at these rude desks sat the older scholars with
their backs to the teacher. Younger scholars sat on
blocks or benches of logs. Until this century many<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[76]</a></span>
schoolhouses did not have glass set in the small
windows, but newspapers or white papers greased
with lard were fastened in the rude sashes, or in
holes cut in the wall, and let in a dim light. At
one end, or in the middle, a "cat and clay" chimney
furnished a fireplace. When the first rough
log cabin was replaced by a better schoolhouse the
hexagonal shape, so beloved in those states for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[77]</a></span>
meeting-houses, was chosen, and occasionally built
in stone. A picture of one still standing and still
used as a schoolhouse, in Raritan, New Jersey, is
here shown. It retained its old shelf desks till a
few years ago.</p>

<p>In a halting way schools in America followed the
customs of English schools. The "potation-penny,"
or "the drinking," was collected in schools in the
colonies. In England a considerable sum was often
gathered for this treat at the end of the term; but
the pennies were doled out more slowly in American
schools. Young Joseph Lloyd (of the family
of Lloyds Neck on Long Island), in the year 1693,
paid out a shilling and sixpence "to the Mistris for
feast and wine." A century later, in a school in
New Hampshire, the children diligently saved the
wood-ashes in the big fireplace and sold them to a
neighboring potash works for their treat. They had
ample funds to buy rum, raisins, and gingerbread for
all who came to the treat, including the ministers
and deacons. It was of this school, doubtless attended
largely by Scotch-Irish children, that the
teacher recorded that the boys, even the youngest,
wore leather aprons, while many of the girls took
snuff. Another old English custom, the barring-out,
occasionally was known here, especially in
Pennsylvania.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span></p>

<p>The furnishing of the schoolrooms was meagre;
there were no blackboards, no maps, seldom was
there a pair of globes. Though Mr. MacMaster
asserts that pencils were never used even in the
early years of our Federal life, his statement is certainly
a mistake. Faber's pencils were made as early
as 1761. Peter Goelet advertised lead pencils for
sale in New York in 1786, with india rubbers, and
as early as 1740 they were offered among booksellers'
wares in Boston for threepence apiece, both
black and red lead. Judge Sewall had one; perhaps
it was not our common lead pencil of to-day.</p>

<p>In 1771 we find the patriot Henry Laurens
writing thus to his daughter Martha, "his dearest
Patsey," when she was about twelve years old.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"... I have recollected your request for a pair of globes,
therefore I have wrote to Mr. Grubb to ship a pair of the
best 18 inch, with caps, and a book of directions, and to
add a case of neat instruments, and one dozen Middleton's
best pencils marked M. L. When you are measuring the
surface of the globe remember you are to cut a part in it,
and think of a plum pudding and other domestic duties.
Your father,</p>

<p class="sig">
"<span class="smcap">Henry Laurens</span>."
</p></blockquote>

<p>Still lead pencils were not in common use even
in city schools till this century. The manuscript<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[79]</a></span>
arithmetics or "sum-books" which I have seen
were always done in ink. Many a country boy
grew to manhood without ever seeing a lead pencil.</p>

<div class="figcenter bord" style="width: 364px;"><a name="pemberton" id="pemberton"></a>

<div class="caption"><p class="center">Samuel Pemberton, Twelve Years Old, 1736</p></div>
</div>

<p>In country schools even till the middle of this
century copy-books were made of foolscap paper
carefully sewed into book shape, and were ruled by
hand. For this children used lead plummets instead
of pencils. These plummets were made of
lead melted and cast in wooden moulds cut out by
the ever ready jackknife and were then tied by a
hempen string to the ruler. These plummets were
usually shaped like a tomahawk, and carefully whittled
and trimmed to a sharp edge. Slightly varied
shapes were a carpenter's or a woodcutter's axe; also
there were cannon, battledores, and cylinders.</p>

<p>Paper was scarce and too highly prized for children
to waste; it was a great burden even to
ministers to get what paper they needed for their
sermons, and they frequently acquired microscopic
hand-writing for economy's sake. To the forest the
scholars turned for the ever plentiful birch bark,
which formed a delightful substitute to cipher on
instead of paper. Among the thrifty Scotch-Irish
settlers in New Hampshire and the planters in
Maine, sets of arithmetic rules were copied by each
child on birch bark and made a substantial text-book.
Rolls of birch bark resembling in shape the parchment<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a></span>
rolls of the Egyptians and lead plummets
seem too ancient in appearance to have been commonly
employed in schools within a century in this
country.</p>

<p>It has been asserted that school slates were not
used till this century. Noah Webster says distinctly
in a letter written about the schools of his
childhood, that "before the Revolution and for
some years after no slates were used in common
schools." S. Town, attending school in Belchertown,
Massachusetts, in 1785, says that slates were
unknown.</p>

<p>I have seen but a single reference to them in
America and that is in such an ingenuous schoolboy's
letter I will quote it in full:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
"To <span class="smcap">Mr. Cornelius Ten Broeck</span></p>

<p>In an advertisement of an English bookseller of
the year 1737, one James Marshal of the Bible and
Sun at Stockton are named Slate Pocket Books,
Slates, and Slate Pens. The first slates were frameless,
and had a hole pierced at one side on which
a pencil could be hung, or by which they could be
suspended around the neck. An old gentleman
told me that he distinctly recalled the first time he
ever saw slates in school. The master brought in
a score that had been ordered to supply his pupils.
He asked if any scholar had a bit of string. My
old gentleman thrust his hand in his pocket and
confidingly brought out his best fishing-line. The
master took it, calmly cut it into twenty lengths,
each long enough to go around the neck of a child
and permit the slate when hung on it to lie loosely
in front of his chest. It was a bitter blow to the
boy to witness the cruel and unexpected severing
of his beloved treasure, and he never forgot it.</p>

<p>In England for centuries existed the custom of
sending young children to the houses of friends,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[82]</a></span>
relatives, or people of some condition and state to
be educated. Young boys were placed in noblemen's
households to learn carving, singing, and
good manners. Young girls went to learn housewifery,
needlework, and etiquette. The work of
these children in what would to-day be deemed the
duties of upper servants was given in payment
for their board and tuition. The housemistress
gained a large corps of orderly, intelligent servitors;
and there was no disgrace in that day in being called
a servant. In the time of Henry VII. these customs
were universal. <cite>The Italian Relation of England</cite>,
of that date, is most severe upon English parents,
saying this putting away of young children, though<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[83]</a></span>
under the guise of having them taught good manners,
was done really through lack of affection,
through greediness. The <cite>Paston Letters</cite>, the <cite>Verney
Papers</cite>, give ample proof that children of good
families were thus banished.</p>

<p>A remnant of this custom of the "putting-forth"
of children lingered in the colonies. A good education
could generally be obtained only in the
schools in larger towns, or in the households of
learned men. The New England ministers almost
universally eked out their meagre incomes by taking
young lads into their homes to educate.</p>

<p>When at school in Andover, Josiah Quincy
boarded with the minister. The boys, eight in
number, slept in a large chamber with four beds,
two boys in each. The fare was ample but simple;
of beef, pork, plentiful vegetables, badly baked rye
and Indian bread. The minister had white bread
as the brown bread gave him the heart-burn.</p>

<p>Children went, if possible, to the house of a kinsman.
An old letter in the <cite>Mather Papers</cite> is from
Mary Hoar. She writes "To her Esteemed Sister,
Mistris Bridget Hoar at Cambridge." One sentence
runs thus:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"I presume our sonn John is left in the hands of a
stranger; which may be of some evel consequence if not
timely prevented and therefore I doe look upon myself as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a></span>
conserned (soe far as I am capable to diserne ye evel at
such a distance) to make my request to you to prevail with
my brother to receive him into your own family that he
may be under your own ey. And to goe to school in the
same town, where you cannot doubtless be destitute of a
good schoolmaster, which might be of singular benefit to
ye child."</p></blockquote>

<p>Bridget Hoar was the daughter of Lady Alice
Lisle, the martyr, and the wife of Leonard Hoar,
president of Harvard College.</p>

<p>Another letter similar in kindly intent is this
written to Henry Wolcott, at Windsor, Connecticut;&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p class="sig">

<p>It was the custom of the wealthy planters of the
island of Barbadoes to send their children to New
England, usually to Boston, to school. At one
time a special school flourished there for the education
of the sons of these planters. Several volumes
of letter books of Hon. Hugh Hall, Judge of the
Admiralty, are in the possession of his descendant,
Miss Margaret Seymour Hall. He had occasional
charge of his younger brothers and sisters, who
were sent to Boston from the Barbadoes, and his
letters frequently refer to them. Many of these
letters are to and from his grandmother, Madam
Lydia Coleman, the daughter of the old Indian
fighter, Captain Joshua Scottow. She had three
husbands,&mdash;Colonel Benjamin Gibbs, Attorney
General Anthony Checkley, and William Coleman.</p>

<p>Richard Hall came to Boston in 1718. His
older brother writes:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"This Northern Air seems well calculated for Richard's
Temperament of body and I am Psuaded he never appeared
so Fat and Sanguine while in Barbados. I am taking all
Imaginable Care in Placing him at our best Grammar
School and have desir'd the Master and Usher to treat him
with the highest Tenderness, Intimating he has a Capacity
to go thro ye Exercises of ye School &amp; that a Mild and
good Natur'd Treatment will best prevail; who have promised
me their Pticular favour to him."</p></blockquote>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[87]</a></span></p>

<p>A few months later the grandmother writes in
various letters:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"Richard is well in health, and minds his Learning and
likes our Cold country better than I do.... I delivered
Richard's Master, Mr. Williams, 25 lbs. Cocoa. I spoke
with him a little before and asked him what he expected
for Richard's schooling. He told me 40 shillings a yeare.
As for Richard since I told him I would write to his Father
he is more orderly, &amp; he is very hungry, and has grown so
much yt all his Clothes is too Little for him. He loves
his book and his play too. I hired him to get a Chapter of
ye Proverbs &amp; give him a penny every Sabbath day, &amp;
promised him 5 shillings when he can say them all by heart.
I would do my duty by his soul as well as his body....
I hope he does consider ye many inconveniences yt
will attend him if he wont be ruled. He has grown a
good boy and minds his School and Lattin and Dancing.
He is a brisk Child &amp; grows very Cute and wont wear
his new silk coat yt was made for him. He wont
wear it every day so yt I don't know what to do with
it. It wont make him a jackitt. I would have him a

hankers &amp; stockens, they ask very deare, 8 shillings for
a paire &amp; Richard takes no care of them.... I put
him in mind of writing but he tells me he don't know
what to write."</p></blockquote>

<p>Then comes Richard's delightful effusion:&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[88]</a></span></p>

<p>Mothers and guardians of the present day who
have sent boys off to the boarding school with ample<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[89]</a></span>
store of neatly marked underclothing, stockings,
and handkerchiefs, and had them return at the holidays
nearly bereft of underwear, bearing stockings
with feet existing only in outlines, and possessing
but two or three handkerchiefs, these in dingy wads
at the bottom of coat-pockets and usually marked
with some other scholar's name&mdash;such can sympathize
with poor, thrifty old lady Coleman, when
naughty Richard tied his good new handkerchiefs
in knots, beat his companions,
and recklessly threw the
knotted strings
away.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER IV</h2>

<h3>WOMEN TEACHERS AND GIRL SCHOLARS</h3>

<blockquote>

<p><em>A godly young Woman of special parts, who was fallen into a
sad infirmity, the loss of her understanding and reason, which had
been growing upon her divers years by occasion of giving herself
wholly to reading and writing and had written many books. Her
husbande was loath to grieve hir; but he saw his error when it was
too late. For if she had attended to her household affairs, and such
things as belong to women, and not gone out of hir way and calling
to meddle in such things as are proper for men whose minds are
stronger, she had kept hir Wits, and might have improved them
usefully and honorably.</em></p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&mdash;
<em>History of New England. Governor John Winthrop, 1640.
</em></p></blockquote>


<p>While the education of the sons of the
planters in all the colonies was bravely
provided and supported, the daughters
fared but poorly. The education of a girl in book
learning was deemed of vastly less importance than
her instruction in household duties. But small arrangement
was made in any school for her presence,
nor was it thought desirable that she should have
any very varied knowledge. That she should read
and write was certainly satisfactory, and cipher a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[91]</a></span>
little; but many girls got on very well without the
ciphering, and many, alas! without the reading and
writing.</p>

<p>There had been a time when English girls and
English gentlewomen had eagerly studied Latin and
Greek; and wise masters, such as Erasmus and Colet
and Roger Ascham had told with pride of their
intelligent English girl scholars; but all that had
passed away with the "good old times." In the
seventeenth century English gentlemen looked with
marked disfavor on learned women.</p>

<p>Sir Ralph Verney, who adored his own little
daughters to the neglect of his sons, and was tender,
devoted, and generous to every little girl of
his acquaintance, wrote about the year 1690 to a
friend:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"Let not your girle learn Latin or short hand; the difficulty
of the first may keep her from that Vice, for soe I

may bee a prejudice to her; for the pride of taking sermon
noates hath made multitudes of woemen most unfortunate.
Had St. Paul lived in our Times I am confident hee would
have fixt a <em>Shame</em> upon our woemen for writing as well as
for speaking in church."</p></blockquote>

<p>Occasionally an intelligent father would carefully
teach his daughters. President Colman of Harvard<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[92]</a></span>
was such a father. He gave what was called a
profound education to his daughter Jane. A letter
of his to her, when she was ten years old, is worthy
of full quotation:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
"<span class="smcap">My dear Child</span>:&mdash;
</p>

<p>"I have this morning your Letter which pleases
me very well and gives me hopes of many a pleasant line
from you in Time to come if God spare you to me and me
to you. I very much long to see your Mother but doubt
whether the weather will permit to-day. I pray God to
bless you and make you one of his Children. I charge you
to pray daily, and read your Bible, and fear to sin. Be
very dutiful to your Mother, and respectful to everybody.
Be very humble and modest, womanly and discreet. Take
care of your health and as you love me do not eat green
apples. Drink sparingly of water, except the day be warm.
When I last saw you, you were too shamefaced; look people
in the face, speak freely and behave decently. I hope
to bring Nabby in her grandfather's Chariot to see you.
The meanwhile I kiss your dear Mother, and commend her
health to the gracious care of God, and you with her to
His Grace. Give my service to Mr. A. and family and
be sure you never forget the respect they have honoured you
with.</p>

<p>Jonathan Edwards was an only son with ten sisters.
In 1711, when he was eight years old, five of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[93]</a></span>
these sisters had been born. The father, Timothy
Edwards, went as chaplain on an expedition to Canada.
His letters home show his care and thought
for his children, girls and boy:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"I desire thee to take care that Jonathan dont lose what
he hath learnt, but that as he hath got the accidence and
about two sides of Propria qu&aelig; maribus by heart, so that
he keep what he hath got I would therefore have him say
pretty often to the girls. I would also have the girls keep
what they have learnt of the Grammar, and get by heart
as far as Jonathan hath learnt; he can keep them as far as
he had learnt. And would have both him and them keep
their writing, and therefore write much oftener than they
did when I was at home. I have left paper enough for
them which they may use to that end."</p></blockquote>

<p>Conditions remained the same throughout the
century. The wife of President John Adams, born
in 1744, the daughter of a New England minister of
good family and social position, doubtless had as
good an education as any girl of her birth and
station. She writes in 1817:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"My early education did not partake of the abundant
opportunities which the present days offer, and which even
our common country schools now afford. I never was
sent to any school. I was always sick. Female education,
in the best families, went no further than writing and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[94]</a></span>
arithmetic; in some few and rare instances music and
dancing."</p></blockquote>

<p>On another occasion she said that female education
had been everywhere neglected, and female learning
ridiculed, and she speaks of the trifling, narrow, contracted
education of American women.</p>

<p>Girls in the other colonies fared no better than
New England damsels. The instruction given to
girls of Dutch and English parentage in New York
was certainly very meagre. Mrs. Anne Grant wrote
an interesting account of her childhood in Albany,
New York, in a book called <cite>Memoir of an American
Lady</cite>. The date was the first half of the eighteenth
century. She said:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"It was at that time very difficult to procure the means
of instruction in those districts; female education was in
consequence conducted on a very limited scale; girls
learned needlework (in which they were indeed both skilful
and ingenious), from their mothers and aunts; they were
taught, too, at that period to read, in Dutch, the Bible, and
a few Calvinistic tracts of the devotional kind. But in the
infancy of the settlement few girls read English; when they
did they were thought accomplished; they generally spoke
it, however imperfectly, and a few were taught writing."</p></blockquote>

<p>William Smith wrote in 1756 that the schools in
New York then were of the lowest order, the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[95]</a></span>
teachers ignorant, and women, especially, ill-educated.
It was the same in Virginia. Mary Ball,
the mother of George Washington, wrote from her
Virginia home when fifteen years old:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"We have not had a schoolmaster in our neighborhood till
now in nearly four years. We have now a young minister
living with us who was educated at Oxford, took orders and
came over as assistant to Rev. Kemp. The parish is too
poor to keep both, and he teaches school for his board.
He teaches Sister Susie and me and Madam Carter's boy
and two girls. I am now learning pretty fast."</p></blockquote>

<p>The <cite>Catechism of Health</cite>, an old-time child's
book, thus summarily and definitely sets girls in
their proper places:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"<em>Query</em>: Ought female children to receive the same
education as boys and have the same scope for play?</p>

<p>"<em>Answer</em>: In their earlier years there should be no difference.
But there are shades of discretion and regards to
propriety which judicious and prudent guardians and
teachers can discern and can adjust and apply."</p></blockquote>

<p>We seldom find any recognition of girls as pupils
in the early public schools. Sometimes it is evident
that they were admitted at times not devoted to the
teaching of boys. For instance, in May, 1767, a
school was advertised in Providence for teaching
writing and arithmetic to "young ladies." But the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[96]</a></span>
girls had to go from six to half-past seven in the
morning, and half-past four to six in the afternoon.
The price for this most inconvenient and ill-timed
schooling was two dollars a quarter. It is pathetic
to read of a learning-hungry little maid in Hatfield,
Massachusetts, who would slip away from her spinning
and knitting and sit on the schoolhouse steps
to listen with eager envy to the boys as they recited
within. When it became popular to have girls attend
public schools, an old farmer on a country school
committee gave these matter-of-fact objections to
the innovation. "In winter it's too far for girls
to walk; in summer they ought to stay at home
to help in the kitchen."</p>

<p>The first school for girls only, where they were
taught in branches not learned in the lower schools,
was started in 1780 in Middletown, Connecticut, by
a graduate of Yale College named William Woodbridge.
Boston girls owed much to a famous
teacher, Caleb Bingham, who came to that city in
1784 and advertised to open a school where girls
could be taught writing, arithmetic, reading, spelling,
and English grammar. His school was eagerly
welcomed, and it prospered. He wrote for his girl
pupils the famous <cite>Young Lady's Accidence</cite>, referred
to in another chapter, and under his teaching
"newspapers were to be introduced in the school<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[97]</a></span>
at the discretion of the master." This is the first
instance&mdash;I believe in any country&mdash;of the reading
of newspapers being ordered by a school committee.</p>

<p>There were always dame-schools, which were
attended by small boys and girls. Rev. John
Barnard, of Marblehead, Massachusetts, was born
in 1681 and was educated in Boston. He wrote
in his old age a sketch of his school life. He
says:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"By that time I had a little passed my sixth year I had
left my reading school, in the latter part of which my
mistress had made me a sort of usher appointing me to
teach some children that were older than myself as well as
some smaller ones. And in which time I had read my
Bible through thrice. My parents thought me to be
weakly because of my thin habit and pale countenance."</p></blockquote>

<p>The penultimate sentence of this account evidently
accounts for the ultimate. It also appears
that this unnamed school dame practised the monitorial
system a century or more before Bell and
Lancaster made their claims of inventing it.</p>

<p>The pay of women teachers who taught the
dame-schools was meagre in the extreme. The
town of Woburn, Massachusetts, reached the lowest
ebb of salary. In 1641 a highly respected widow,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[98]</a></span>
one Mrs. Walker, kept a school in a room of her
own house. The town agreed to pay her ten shillings
for the first year; but after deducting seven
shillings for taxes, and various small amounts for
produce, etc., she received finally from the town
<em>one shilling and three pence</em> for her pedagogical work.</p>

<p>Elizabeth Wright was the first teacher in the
town of Northfield, Massachusetts. She taught
a class of young children at her own house for
twenty-two weeks each summer; for this she received
fourpence a week for each child. At this
time she had four young children of her own. She
took all the care of them and did all the work of
her household, made shirts for the Indians for eight-pence
each, and breeches for Englishmen for one
shilling sixpence a pair, and wove much fine linen
to order. For the summer school at Franklin,
Connecticut, in 1798, "a qualified woman teacher"
had but sixty-seven cents a week pay. Men
teachers who taught both girls and boys usually
had better pay; but Samuel Appleton, in later life
the well-known Boston merchant and philanthropist,
was my great-grandfather's teacher in the year 1786.
His pay was his board, lodging, and washing, and
sixty-seven cents per week, and it was deemed liberal
and ample.</p>

<p>There were always in the large cities small classes
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[99]</a></span>where favored girls could be taught the rudiments of
an education, and there were many private teachers
who taught young misses. Boston gentlewomen
from very early days had a mode of eking out a
limited income by taking little girls and young ladies
from country homes, especially from the southern
colonies and the Barbadoes, to board while they attended
these classes and recited to these teachers.</p>

<p>Many honored New England names appear
among the advertisements of those desiring boarders.
Mrs. Deming wrote to her niece, Anna Green
Winslow, telling her of two boarders she had:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"Had I time and spirits I could acquaint you of an
expedition the two sisters made to Dorchester, a walk
begun at sunrise last Thursday morning&mdash;dress'd in their
dammasks, padusoy, gauze, ribbins, flapetts, flowers, new
white hats, white shades, and black leather shoes (Paddington's
make) and finish'd, journey, garments, orniments and
all quite finish'd on Saturday before noon (mud over shoes)
never did I behold such destruction in so short a space&mdash;bottom
of padusoy coat fring'd quite around, besides places
worn entire to floss, and besides frays, dammask from
shoulders to bottom not lightly soil'd, but as if every part
had rub'd tables and chairs that had long been us'd to wax
mingl'd with grease.</p>

<p>"I could have cried, for I really pitied em&mdash;nothing
left fit to be seen. They had leave to go, but it never<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[100]</a></span>
entered anyone's tho'ts but their own to be dressed in all
(even to loading) of their best. What signifies it to worry
ourselves about beings that are and will be just so? I can,
and do, pity and advise, but I shall get no credit by such-like.
The eldest talks much of learning dancing, musick
(the spinet and guitar) embroidery, dresden, the French
tongue, &amp;c. The younger with an air of her own advis'd
the elder when she first mention'd French to learn first to
read English and was answer'd, 'Law, so I can well eno'
a'ready.' You've heard her do what she calls reading, I
believe. Poor Creature! Well! we have a time of it!"</p></blockquote>

<p>There is a beautifully written letter in existence
of Elizabeth Saltonstall, sent to her young daughter
Elizabeth on July 26, 1680, when the latter was
away from home and attending school. It abruptly
begins:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>

"<span class="smcap">Betty</span>:<br />
</p>

<p>"Having an opportunity to send to you, I could
doe no less than write a few lines to mind you that you

respectively and loveingly to the children, and soberly in
words and actions to the servants: and be sure you keep
yourself diligently imployed either at home or at school, as
Mrs. Graves shall order you. Doe nothing without her
leave, and assure yourself it will be a great preservative from
falling into evill to keep yourself well imployed. But with
all and in the first place make it your dayly work to pray<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[101]</a></span>
earnestly to God that he would keep you from all manner
of evil. Take heed of your discourse at all times that it
be not vaine and foolish but know that for every idle word
you must certainly give account another day. Be sure to
follow your reading, omit it not one day: your father doth
propose to send you some coppies that so you may follow
your wrighting likewise. I shall say no more at present
but only lay a strict charge upon you that you remember
and practise what I have minded you of: and as you desire

careful to observe the counsell of your parents and consider

<p>Old Madam Coleman, who had somewhat of a
handful in her grandson, Richard Hall, during his
school days, was given charge of his sister Sarah, in
1719, to care for and guard while she received an
education. When Missy arrived from the Barbadoes
she was eight years old. She brought with her
a maid. The grandmother wrote back cheerfully to
the parents that the child was well and brisk, as indeed
she was. All the very young gentlemen and
young ladies of Boston Brahmin blood paid her
visits, and she gave a feast at a child's dancing party<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[102]</a></span>
with the sweetmeats left over from her sea-store.
Her stay in her grandmother's household was surprisingly
brief. She left unceremoniously and unbidden
with her maid, and went to a Mr. Binning's
to board; she sent home word to the Barbadoes
that her grandmother made her drink water with
her meals. Her brother wrote at once in return to
Madam Coleman:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"We were all persuaded of your tender and hearty affection
to my Sister when we recommended her to your parental
care. We are sorry to hear of her Independence in removing
from under the Benign Influences of your Wing &amp; am
surprised she dare do it without our leave or consent or
that Mr. Binning receive her at his house before he knew how
we were affected to it. We shall now desire Mr. Binning
to resign her with her waiting maid to you and in our Letter
to him have strictly ordered her to Return to your House.
And you may let her know before my Father took his departure
for London he desired me peremptorily to enjoin it,
and my Mother and myself back it with our Commands,
which we hope she wont venture to refuse or disobey."</p></blockquote>

<p>But no brother could control this spirited young
damsel. Three months later a letter from Madam
Coleman read thus:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"Sally wont go to school nor to church and wants a nue
muff and a great many other things she don't need. I tell
her fine things are cheaper in Barbadoes. She says she will<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[103]</a></span>
go to Barbados in the Spring. She is well and brisk, says
her Brother has nothing to do with her as long as her
father is alive."</p></blockquote>

<p>Hugh Hall wrote in return, saying his daughter
ought to have one room to sleep in, and her maid
another, that it was not befitting children of their
station to drink water, they should have wine and
beer. The grandmother was not offended with him
or the children, but shielded the boy from rebuke
when he was sent from one school to another; said
proudly he was "a child of great parts, ye best
Dancer of any in town," and could learn as much in
an hour as another in three hours. The bill for the
dancing lessons still exists. Richard's dancing lessons
for a year and a quarter cost seven pounds.
Sally's for four months, two pounds. Four months'
instruction in writing (and pens, ink, and paper) was
one pound seven shillings and four pence. The entrance
fee for dancing lessons was a pound apiece.
Sally learned "to sew, floure, write, and dance."
The brisk child grew up a dashing belle, and married
Major John Wentworth, brother of Governor Benning
Wentworth. Good Brother Richard writes:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"I heartily rejoice in Sally's good fortune and hope
Molly will have her turn also, but it would not have been
fair to let Sally dance barefoot which I hear Molly expected
would have been done."</p></blockquote>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[104]</a></span></p>

<p>Sister Molly married first Adam Winthrop and
then Captain William Wentworth. The two sisters
were left widows and lived till great old age in the
famous old Wentworth House in Portsmouth, New
Hampshire, both dying in 1790.</p>

<p>Mistress Agan Blair of Williamsburg, Virginia,
married one Colonel John Banister of Petersburg;
her letters, even in old age, are full of a charming
freedom of description and familiarity of language,
even amounting to slang, which are very unusual in
correspondence of that day. They are printed in
the <cite>History of the Blair and Braxton Families</cite>. She
writes to her sister, Mrs. Braxton, of the latter's
little daughter, Betsey, in the year 1769:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"Betsey is at work for you. I suppose she will tell you
to-morrow is Dancing Day, for it is in her Thoughts by
Day &amp; her dreams by Night. Mr. Fearson was so surprised
to find she knew so much of the Minuet step, and
could not help asking if Miss had never been taught. So
you will find she is likely to make some progress that way.
Mr. Wray by reason of business has but lately taken her in
hand tho' he assures me a little practice is all she wants; her
Reading I hear twice a day. And when I go out she is consigned
over to my Sister Blair: we have had some few
Quarrels and one Battle. Betsey and her Cousin Jenny
had been fighting for several days successively &amp; was
threatened to be whipt for it as often but they did not regard<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[105]</a></span>
us. Her Mamma &amp; self thought it necessary to let
them see we were in earnest&mdash;if they have fought since
we have never heard of it. She has finish'd her work'd
Tucker, but ye weather is so warm that with all ye pains I
can take with clean hands and so forth she cannot help
dirtying it a little. I do not observe her to be fond of
negroes company, nor have I heard lately of any bad words;
chief of our Quarrels is for eating of those green Apples in
our garden and not keeping the head smooth.... I have
had Hair put on Miss Dolly but find it is not in my power
of complying with my promise in giving her Silk for a
Sacque and Coat. Some of our pretty Gang broke open a
Trunk in my Absence and stole several Things of which
the Silk makes a part. So imagine Betsey will petition you
for some. I am much obliged for the care you have taken
to get all my Duds together, I cannot find you have neglected
putting up anything for Betsey."</p></blockquote>

<p>It will readily be seen from all these letters that
whether the little girl was taught at home or in a
private school, to "sew, floure, write, and dance"
were really the chief things she learned, usually the
only things, save deportment and elegance of carriage.
To attain an erect and dignified bearing
growing girls were tortured as in English boarding
schools by sitting in stocks, wearing harnesses, and
being strapped to backboards. The packthread
stays and stiffened coats of "little Miss Custis"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[106]</a></span>
were made still more unyielding by metal and wood
busks; the latter made of close-grained heavy wood.
These were often carved in various designs or with
names and verses, or ornamented with drawings in
colored inks, and made a favorite gift.</p>

<div class="figcenter bord" style="width: 400px;"><a name="busks" id="busks"></a>
<img src="images/i034.jpg" width="400" height="486" alt="busks" />
<div class="caption"><p class="center">Carved Busks</p></div>
</div>

<p>All these constrainments and accessories contributed
to a certain thin-chested though erect appearance,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[107]</a></span>
which is notable in the portraits of girls and
women painted in the past century.</p>

<p>The backboard certainly helped to produce an
erect and dignified carriage, and was assisted by
the quick, graceful motions used in wool-spinning.
The daughter of the Revolutionary patriot General
Nathanael Greene stated to her grandchildren that
in her girlhood she sat every day with her feet
in stocks, strapped to a backboard. She was until
the end of her long life a straight-backed elegant
dame.</p>

<p>Many of the portraits given in this book plainly
show the reign of the backboard. The portrait of
Elizabeth Storer, facing page 98, is perhaps the
best example. It is authenticated as having been
painted by Smibert when the subject was but twelve
years old, but she is certainly a most mature-faced
child.</p>

<p>Another straight-backed portrait, opposite page
108, is the famous one immortalized in rhyme by Dr.
Oliver Wendell Holmes, that of "Dorothy Q.," the
daughter of Judge Edmund Quincy. The poet's
lines are more simply descriptive than any prose.</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Grandmother's mother: her age, I guess<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Thirteen summers or something less,<br /></span>

<span class="i1">Lips that lover has never kissed,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Taper fingers and slender wrist.<br /></span>

<span class="i1">And in her slender shape are seen<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Hint and promise of stately mien."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>It would be no effort of the imagination to stretch
the poet's "thirteen summers or less" to thirty summers.</p>

<div class="caption"><p class="center">"Dorothy Q." "Thirteen Summers," 1720 <em>circa</em></p></div>
</div>

<p>Of associate interest is the portrait of Elizabeth
Quincy, her sister, facing page 112. The faces, hair,
and dress are similar, but the parrot is replaced by
an impossible little dog. Elizabeth is somewhat
fairer to look upon. Dorothy is certainly "nothing
handsome." On the back of the portrait is written
this inscription: "It pleased God to take Out of
Life my Honor'd and dearly Belov'd Mother, M<sup>r</sup>s
Elizabeth Wendell, daughter to Honble Edmund
Quincy, Esq<sup>r</sup>. March, 1746, aged 39 Years."
Her brother Edmund Quincy married her husband's
sister Elizabeth (thus the two Elizabeths<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[109]</a></span>
exchanged surnames), and Dorothy Q. married
Edward Jackson.</p>

<p>The desire of girls and women to be ethereal and
slender, delicate and shrinking, began over a century
ago, but reached a climax in the early years of this
century. To effect this, severe measures were taken
in girls' schools. Dr. Holmes wrote in jest, but
in truth too:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem">
<span class="i0">"They braced my aunt against a board<br /></span>
<span class="i3">To make her straight and tall,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">They laced her up, they starved her down,<br /></span>
<span class="i3">To make her light and small.<br /></span>
<span class="i1">They pinched her feet, they singed her hair,<br /></span>
<span class="i3">They screwed it up with pins&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Oh, never mortal suffered more<br /></span>
<span class="i3">In penance for her sins."<br /></span>
</div>

<p>Though Madam Coleman, a Boston Puritan,
told so proudly of her grandchildren's dancing, that
accomplishment, or rather integral part of a little
lass's education, had not been quietly promoted in
that sober city. In early years both magistrates and
ministers had declaimed against it.</p>

<p>In 1684 Increase Mather preached a strong sermon
against what he termed "Gynecandrical Dancing
or that which is commonly called Mixt or
Promiscuous Dancing of Men and Women, be they
elder or younger Persons together." He called it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[110]</a></span>
the great sin of the Daughters of Zion, and he bursts
forth:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"Who were the Inventors of Petulant Dancings?
Learned men have well observed that the Devil was the
First Inventor of the impleaded Dances, and the Gentiles
who worshipped him the first Practitioners of this Art."</p></blockquote>

<p>Of course he could not be silent as to the dancings
of Miriam and David in the Bible, but disposed of
them summarily thus, "Those Instances are not at
all to the Purpose." Preaching against dancing was
as futile as against wig-wearing; "Horrid Bushes of
Vanity" soon decked every head, and gay young
feet tripped merrily to the sound of music in every
village and town. Dancing could not be repressed
in an age when there was so little other excitement,
so great physical activity, and so narrow a range of
conversation; and after a time "Ordination-balls"
were given when a new minister was ordained.</p>

<p>Dancing was a pleasant accomplishment, and a
serious one in good society. The regard of it as a
formal function is proved by the story the Marquis
de Chastellux told of the Philadelphia Assembly.
A young lady who was up in a country dance spoke
for a moment to a friend and thus forgot her turn.
The Master of Ceremonies, Colonel Mitchell, immediately
came to her side and said severely: "Give<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[111]</a></span>
over, Miss. Take care what you are about. Do
you think you came here for your pleasure?"</p>

<p>It was a much more varied art than is ordinarily
taught to-day. Signor Sodi taught rigadoons and
paspies in Philadelphia; John Walsh added the
Spanish fandango. Other modish dances were
"Allemand vally's, De la cours, Devonshire jiggs,
Minuets." Complicated contra-dances were many in
number and quaint in name: The Innocent Maid,
A Successful Campaign, Priest's House, Clinton's
Retreat, Blue Bonnets, The Orange Tree.</p>

<p>A letter from an interesting little child shows that
dancing was deemed part of a "liberal education."</p>

<p>We have much contemporary evidence to show
that music, as a formulated study, was rarely taught
till after the Revolution. But there never was a
time in colonial life when music was not loved and
clung to with a sentiment that is difficult of explanation,
but must not be underrated.</p>

<p>Dr. John Earle gives in his <cite>Microcosmographie</cite>,
the character of a Puritan woman, or a "shee-precise
Hypocrite," saying "shee suffers not her
daughters to learne on the Virginalls, because of
their affinity with the Organs," yet I find Judge
Sewall, a true Puritan, taking his wife's virginals to
be repaired. I supposed she played psalm tunes
on them. Spinets and harpsichords were brought
to wealthy citizens. Copies of old-time music
show how very elementary were the performances
on these instruments. Listeners were profoundly
moved at the sound, but it would seem far from
inspiring to-day.</p>

<div class="poem">

<span class="i1">Or carrolling to a spinet with its thin, metallic thrills."<br /></span>

<p>Even the "new Clementi with glittering keys"
gave but a tinny sound. Girls "raised a tune," however,
to these far from resonant accompaniments,
and sung their ballads and sentimental ditties, unhampered
by thoughts of technique and methods<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[113]</a></span>
and schools. Many of these old musical instruments
are still in existence. The harpsichord
bought for "little Miss Custis" is in its rightful
home at Mount Vernon.</p>

<p>By Revolutionary times, girls' boarding schools
had sprung into existence in large towns, and
certainly filled a great want. One New England
school, haloed with romance, was kept by Mrs.
Susanna Rawson, who was an actress, the daughter
of an English officer, and married to a musician.
She was also a play-writer and wrote one novel of
great popularity, <cite>Charlotte Temple</cite>. Eliza Southgate
Bowne gives some glimpses of the life at this school
in her letters. She was fourteen years when she
thus wrote to her father:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
"<span class="smcap">Hon. Father</span>:
</p>

<p>"I am again placed at school under the tuition of
an amiable lady, so mild, so good, no one can help loving
her; she treats all her scholars with such tenderness as
would win the affection of the most savage brute. I learn
Embroiderey and Geography at present, and wish your
permission to learn Musick.... I have described one
of the blessings of creation in Mrs. Rawson, and now I
will describe Mrs. Lyman as the reverse: she is the worst
woman I ever knew of or that I ever saw, nobody knows
what I suffered from the treatment of that woman."</p></blockquote>

<p>This Mrs. Lyman kept a boarding school at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[114]</a></span>
Medford; eight girls slept in one room, the fare
was meagre, and the education kept close company
with the fare.</p>

<p>The Moravian schools at Bethlehem, Pennsylvania,
were widely popular. President John
Adams wrote to his daughter of the girls' school
that one hundred and twenty girls lived in one
house and slept in one garret in single beds in two
long rows. He says, "How should you like to
live in such a nunnery?" Eliza Southgate Bowne
wrote a pretty account of this school:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"The first was merely a <em>sewing school</em>, little children and
a pretty single sister about 30, with her white skirt, white
short tight waistcoat, nice handkerchief pinned outside, a
muslin apron and a close cap, of the most singular form you
can imagine. I can't describe it. The hair is all put out of
sight, turned back, and no border to the cap, very unbecoming
and very singular, tied under the chin with a pink
ribbon&mdash;blue for the married, white for the widows. Here
was a Piano forte and another sister teaching a little
girl music. We went thro' all the different school rooms,
some misses of sixteen, their teachers were very agreeable
and easy, and in every room was a Piano."</p></blockquote>

<p>She also tells of the great dormitory; the beds of
singular shape, high and covered; a single hanging-lamp
lighted at night, with one sister walking patrol.</p>

<p>Though the education given to girls in these<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[115]</a></span>
boarding schools was not very profound, they had
at the close of the school year a grand opportunity
of "showing-off" in a school exhibition. Mary
Grafton Dulany wrote when thirteen years old to
her father, from a Philadelphia school:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"I went to Madame B.s exhibition. There were five
Crowns, two principal for Eminence in Lessons, and
Virtue. They were crowned in great style in the Assembly
Rooms in the presence of 500 Spectators."</p></blockquote>

<p>Mrs. Quincy wrote of a school which she attended
in 1784, of what she termed "the breaking up":&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"A stage was erected at the end of the room, covered
with a carpet, ornamented with evergreens and lighted by
candles in gilt branches. Two window curtains were
drawn aside from the centre before it and the audience
were seated on the benches of the schoolroom. The
'Search after Happiness,' by Mrs. More, 'The Milliner,'
and 'The Dove,' by Madame Genlis were performed.
In the first I acted Euphelia, one of the court ladies, and
also sung a song intended in the play for one of the
daughters of Urania, but as I had the best voice it was
given to me. My dress was a pink and green striped silk,
feathers and flowers decorated my head; and with bracelets
on my arms and paste buckles on my shoes I thought I
made a splendid appearance. The only time I ever rode
in a sedan chair was on this occasion, when after being
dressed at home, I was conveyed in one to Miss Ledyard's
residence. Hackney coaches were then unknown in New<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[116]</a></span>
York. In the second piece I acted the milliner and by some
strange notion of Miss Ledyard's or my own was dressed
in a gown, cap, handkerchief and apron of my mother's,
with a pair of spectacles to look like an elderly woman&mdash;a
proof how little we understood the character of a
French milliner. When the curtain was drawn, many of
the audience declared it must be Mrs. Morton herself on
the stage. How my mother with her strict notions and
prejudices against the theatre ever consented to such proceedings
is still a surprise to me."</p></blockquote>

<p>All parents did not approve of those exhibitions.
Major Dulany wrote with decision to his daughter
that he lamented the boldness and over-assurance
which accompanied any success in such performances,
and which proceeded, he deemed, from callous
feeling.</p>

<p>These plays were merely a revival of an old
fashion when English school children took part in
miracle plays or mysteries. In the seventeenth
century schoolmasters took great pride in writing
exhibition plays for their pupils. Dreary enough
these acts or interludes are. One forced all the
characters to act "anomalies of all the
chiefest parts of grammar"&mdash;oh!
the poor lads that therein
played their
parts!</p>

<h3>HORNBOOK AND PRIMER</h3>

<div class="stanza">
<span class="i4">&mdash;<cite>A Book for Boys and Girls, or Country Rhimes for Children. John Bunyan, 1686.</cite><br /></span>
</div></div>


<p>The English philosopher, John Locke, in
his <cite>Thoughts concerning Education</cite>, written
in 1690, says the method of teaching children
to read in England at that time was always
"the ordinary road of Horn-book, Primer, Psalter,
Testament, and Bible." These, he said, "engage
the liking of children and tempt them to read."
The road was the same in New England, but it
would hardly be called a tempting method.</p>

<p>The first book from which the children of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[118]</a></span>
colonists learned their letters and to spell, was not
really a book at all, in our sense of the word. It
was what was called a hornbook. A thin piece of
wood, usually about four or five inches long and two
inches wide, had placed upon it a sheet of paper a
trifle smaller, printed at the top with the alphabet in
large and small letters; below were simple syllables
such as ab, eb, ib, ob, etc.; then came the Lord's
Prayer. This printed page was covered with a thin
sheet of yellowish horn, which was not as transparent
as glass, yet permitted the letters to be read
through it; and both the paper and the horn were
fastened around the edges to the wood by a narrow
strip of metal, usually brass, which was tacked down
by fine tacks or nails. It was, therefore, a book
of a single page. At the two upper corners of the
page were crosses, hence to read the hornbook was
often called "reading a criss-cross row." At the
lower end of the wooden back was usually a little
handle which often was pierced with a hole; thus the
hornbook could be carried by a string, which could
be placed around the neck or hung by the side.</p>

<div class="figcenter bord" style="width: 400px;"><a name="hornbook" id="hornbook"></a>

<div class="caption"><p class="center">Hornbook owned by Mrs. Anne Robinson Minturn</p></div>
</div>

<p>When, five years ago, was published my book
entitled <cite>Customs and Fashions in Old New England</cite>,
I wrote that I did not know of the preservation of
a single hornbook in America; though for many
years eager and patient antiquaries, of English and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[119]</a></span>
of American blood, had vainly sought in American
historical collections, in American libraries, in American
rural homes, for a true American hornbook; that
is, one studied by American children of colonial
times. The publication of my statement has made
known to me three American hornbooks. The
first is the shabby little treasure owned by Mrs.
Anne Robinson Minturn of Shoreham, Vermont,
found hidden under the dusty eaves of a Vermont
garret. The illustration shows its exact size. On
the back is a paper coarsely stamped in red with a
portrait of Charles II., king of England, on horseback.
This may indicate its age, but not its exact
date. The young colonist who owned it was by
this print taught loyalty to the Crown, though in a
far land.</p>

<p>The second hornbook is owned by Miss Grace
L. Gordon of Flushing, Long Island. It is a family
heirloom, having come to its present owner
through a great-uncle who was born in 1782, and
stated that it was used by his father, who was born
in 1736. The tablet is of oak, and the back is
covered with a red paper stamped with the design
of a double-headed eagle. The third, owned by
Mrs. John W. Norton of Guildford, Connecticut, is
almost precisely like Miss Gordon's, and is equally
well preserved.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[120]</a></span></p>

<div class="caption"><p class="center">Hornbook owned by Miss Gordon</p></div>
</div>

<p>From these shabby little relics and from thousands
of their ill-printed, but useful kinsfolk, childish
lips in America first read aloud the letters, pointed
firmly out by a knitting needle in some dame's<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[121]</a></span>
hand. Undisturbed by kindergarten inductions
and suggestions, unbewildered by baleful processes
and diagrams, unthreatened by scientific principles
of instruction, did the young colonists stoutly shout
their a-b abs, did they spell out their prayer, did
they read in triumphal chorus their criss-cross row.
Isn't it strange that these three lonely little ghosts
of old-time schooling should be the only representatives
of their regiments of classmates? Wouldn't it
seem that tender association, or miserly hoarding,
or even forgetful neglect would have made some
greater salvage from the vast number of hornbooks
sent to this country in the century after its settlement;
that by intent or accident many scores would
have survived? But these are all; three little
battered oaken backs and stubby handles, three
faded paper slips, a splintered sheet or two of
horn, a few strips of brass tape, a score of tiny
hand-wrought nails&mdash;all poor things enough, but
shaping themselves into precious and treasured
relics. Another of their kindred, a penny hornbook,
proved its present value at a sale in London
in 1893, by fetching the far from ignoble sum of
sixty-five pounds.</p>

<p>One of these little hornbooks filled in its single
self what has become a vast item in public school
expenses. As Mr. Martin wittily expresses it, "it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[122]</a></span>
was in embryo all that the Massachusetts statutes
now designate by the formal phrase 'text-books
and supplies.'"</p>

<p>The knitting needle of the schooldame could be
dignified by the pompous name of fescue, a pointer;
and something of that nature, a straw, a pin, a quill,
a skewer of wood, was always used to direct children's
eyes to letter or word.</p>

<p>There certainly were plenty of these humble little
engines of instruction in America; old Judge Sewall
had them for his fourteen children at the end of
the seventeenth century, as we know from his diary;
he wrote in 1691 of his son Joseph going to school
"his cousin Jane accompanying him, carrying his
horn-book." Waitstill Winthrop sent them to his
little Connecticut Plantation nieces in 1716. It is
told of one zealous Puritan minister that hating
the symbolism of the cross he blotted it out of the
criss-cross row of a number of hornbooks imported
to Boston.</p>

</div>

<p>"Gilt horns" were sold in Philadelphia with
Bibles and Primers, as we learn from the <cite>Pennsylvania
Gazette</cite> of December 4, 1760, and in New
York in 1753, so says the <cite>New York Gazette</cite> of May
14, of that year. Pretty little lesson-toys, these
gilded horns must have proved, but not so fine as
the hornbooks of silver and ivory used by young<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[123]</a></span>
misses of quality in England. Scores of pictures by
seventeenth-century artists&mdash;on canvas and glass&mdash;show
demure little maids and masters with hanging
hornbooks. Even the pictures of the Holy Family<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[124]</a></span>
show the infant Christ, hornbook in hand, tenderly
taught by the Virgin Mother.</p>

<p>The hornbook was called by other names, horn-gig,
horn-bat, battledore-book, absey-book, etc.;
and in Dutch it was the <i>a-b-boordje</i>. They were
worked in needlework, and written in ink, and
stamped on tin and carved in wood, as well as
printed, and Prior tells in rhyme of a hornbook,
common enough in England, which must have
proved eminently satisfactory to the student.</p>

</div>

<p>To this day in England, at certain Fairs and in
Kensington bake-shops, these gingerbread hornbooks
are made and sold in spite of the solemn

<p>I have seen in New England what were called
"cookey-moulds," which were of heavy wood incised
with the alphabet, were of ancient Dutch manufacture,
and had been used for making those
"koeckje" hornbooks.</p>

</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[125]</a></span></p>

<p>The sight of an old hornbook must always be
of interest to any one of any power of imagination
or of thoughtful mind, who can read between the
irregular lines, the ill-shapen letters, its true significance
as the emblem, the well-spring of English
education and literature. This thought of the symbolism
of the hornbook is expressed in quaint words
on the back of a shabby battered specimen of questionable
age in the British Museum:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"What more could be wished for even by a literary
Gourmand under the Tudors than to be able to Read and
Spell; to repeat that holy Charm before which fled all
unholy Ghosts, Goblins, or even the Old Gentleman himself,
to the very bottom of the Red Sea; to say that immortal
Prayer which seems Heaven to all who <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">ex animo</i> use
it; and to have those mathematical powers by knowing
units, from which spring countless myriads."</p></blockquote>

<p>For a fuller account of the hornbook, readers
should go to the <cite>History of the Hornbook</cite>, by
Andrew W. Tuer, two splendid volumes forming
one of the most interesting and exhaustive accounts
of any special educational topic that has
ever been written.</p>

<p>The printed cardboard battledore was a successor
of the hornbook. This was often printed on a double
fold of stiff card with a third fold or flap lapping<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[126]</a></span>
over like an old pocket-book. These battledores
were issued in such vast numbers that it is futile
to attempt even to allude to the myriad of publishers.
An affine of the hornbook is seen in the wooden
"reading-boards" which were used a hundred years
ago in Erasmus Hall, the famous old academy built
in 1786 in Flatbush, Long Island. It is still standing
and still used for educational purposes. These
"reading-boards" are tablets of wood, fifteen inches
long, covered on either side with time-yellowed paper
printed in large letters with some simple reading-lesson.
The old fashioned long s in the type proves
their age. Through a pierced hole a loop of string
suspended these boards before a class of little scholars,
who doubtless all read in chorus. Similar ones
bearing the alphabet are still used in Cornish Sunday-schools.
They were certainly used in Dutch
schools, two centuries ago, as the illustrations of
old Dutch books prove.</p>

<p>A prymer or primer was specifically and ecclesiastically
before and after the Reformation in England
a book of private devotions. As authorized
by the Church, and written or printed partially or
wholly in the vernacular, it contained devotions for
the hours, the Creed, Lord's Prayer, Ten Commandments,
some psalms and certain instructions as to
the elements of Christian knowledge. These little<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[127]</a></span>
books often opened with the criss-cross row or
alphabet arranged hornbook fashion, hence the term
primer naturally came to be applied to all elementary
books for children's use. A, B, C, the Middle-English
name for the alphabet in the forms apsey,
abce, absie, etc., was also given to what we now call
a primer. Shakespeare called it absey-book. The
list in <cite>Dyves Pragmaticus</cite> runs:&mdash;</p>

<p>The book which succeeded the hornbook in general
use was the <cite>New England Primer</cite>. It was the
most universally studied school-book that has ever
been used in America; for one hundred years
it was <em>the</em> school-book of America; for nearly another
hundred years it was frequently printed and
much used. More than three million copies of this
<cite>New England Primer</cite> were printed, so declares its
historian, Paul Leicester Ford. These were studied
by many more millions of school-children. All of
us whose great-grandparents were American born
may be sure that those great-grandparents, and
their fathers and mothers and ancestors before them
learned to read from one of these little books. It
was so religious in all its teachings and suggestions
that it has been fitly called the "Little Bible of
New England."</p>

<p>It is a poorly printed little book about five inches
long and three wide, of about eighty pages. It contains
the alphabet, and a short table of easy syllables,
such as a-b ab, e-b eb, and words up to those of six
syllables. This was called a syllabarium. There
were twelve five-syllable words; of these five were
<em>abomination</em>, <em>edification</em>, <em>humiliation</em>, <em>mortification</em>, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[129]</a></span>
<em>purification</em>. There were a morning and evening
prayer for children, and a grace to be said before
meat. Then followed a set of little rhymes which
have become known everywhere, and are frequently
quoted. Each letter of the alphabet is illustrated
with a blurred little picture. Of these, two-thirds
represent Biblical incidents. They begin:&mdash;</p>

<p>In the early days of the Primer, all the colonies
were true to the English king, and the rhyme for the
letter K reads:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem">
<span class="i0">"King Charles the Good<br /></span>
<span class="i1">No man of blood."<br /></span>
</div>

<p>But by Revolutionary years the verse for K was
changed to:&mdash;</p>

<span class="i0">"Queens and Kings<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Are Gaudy Things."<br /></span>

<p>Later verses tell the praise of George Washington.
Then comes a series of Bible questions and answers;
then an "alphabet of lessons for youth," consisting of
verses of the Bible beginning successively with A, B,
C, and so on. X was a difficult initial letter, and had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[130]</a></span>
to be contented with "Xhort one another daily,
etc." After the Lord's Prayer and Apostle's Creed
appeared sometimes a list of names for men and
women, to teach children to spell their own names.
The largest and most interesting picture was that
of the burning at the stake of John Rogers; and
after this a six page set of pious rhymes which the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[131]</a></span>
martyr left at his death for his family of small children.</p>

<p>After the year 1750, a few very short stories were
added to its pages, and were probably all the children's
stories that many of the scholars of that day
ever saw. It is interesting to see that the little
prayer so well known to-day, beginning "Now I lay
me down to sleep," is usually found in the <cite>New
England Primer</cite> of dates later than the year 1737.
The <cite>Shorter Catechism</cite> was, perhaps, the most important
part of this primer. It was so called in
contrast to the catechism in use in England called
<cite>The Careful Father and Pious Child</cite>, which had
twelve hundred questions with answers. The <cite>Shorter
Catechism</cite> had but a hundred and seven questions,
though some of the answers were long. Usually
another catechism was found in the primer, called
<cite>Spiritual Milk for Babes</cite>. It was written by the
Boston minister, John Cotton, and it had but
eighty-seven questions with short answers. Sometimes
a <em>Dialogue between Christ, Youth, and the Devil</em>
was added.</p>

<p>The <cite>Shorter Catechism</cite> was the special delight of
all New Englanders. Cotton Mather called it a
"little watering pot" to shed good lessons. He
begged writing masters to set sentences from it to
be copied by their pupils; and he advised mothers<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[132]</a></span>
to "continually drop something of the Catechism
on their children, as Honey from the Rock."
Learning the catechism was enforced by law in
New England, and the deacons and ministers visited
and examined families to see that the law was
obeyed. Thus it may plainly be seen that
this primer truly filled the requisites of
what the Roxbury school trustees
called "scholastical, theological,
and moral
discipline."</p>

<h2>CHAPTER VI</h2>

<h3>SCHOOL-BOOKS</h3>

<blockquote>

<p><em>The most worthless book of a bygone day is a record worthy of
preservation. Like a telescopic star, its obscurity may render it
unavailable for most purposes, but it serves in hands which know
how to use it to determine the places of more important bodies.</em></p>

<p class="sig">
&mdash;<em>A. de Morgan, 1847.</em>
</p></blockquote>


<p>When any scholar could advance beyond
hornbook and primer he was ready for
grammar. This was not English grammar,
but Latin, and the boy usually began to study
it long before he had any book to con. A bulky
and wretched grammar called Lilly's was most popular
in England. Locke said the study of it was a
religious observance without which no scholar was
orthodox. It named twenty-five different kinds of
nouns and devoted twenty-two pages of solid print
to declensions of nouns; it gave seven genders, with
fifteen pages of rules for genders and exceptions.
Under such a r&eacute;gime we can sympathize with
Nash's outburst, "Syntaxis and prosodia! you are<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[134]</a></span>
tormentors of wit and good for nothing but to get
schoolmasters twopence a week."</p>

<p>It was said of Ezekiel Cheever, the old Boston
schoolmaster, who taught for over seventy years,
"He taught us Lilly and he Gospel taught." But
he also wrote a Latin grammar of his own, <cite>Cheever's
Accidence</cite>, which had unvarying popularity for
over a century. Cheever was a thorough grammarian.
Cotton Mather thus eulogized him:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem">
<span class="i0">"Were Grammar quite extinct, yet at his Brain<br /></span>
<span class="i1">The Candle might have well been Lit again."<br /></span>
</div>

<p>There was brought forth at his death a broadside
entitled <cite>The Grammarian's Funeral</cite>. A fac-simile
of it is here given. Josiah Quincy, later in life
the president of Harvard College, wrote an account
of his dismal school life at Andover. He
entered the school when he was six years old, and
on the form by his side sat a man of thirty. Both
began <cite>Cheever's Accidence</cite>, and committed to memory
pages of a book which the younger child certainly
could not understand, and no advance was permitted
till the first book was conquered. He
studied through the book twenty times before mastering
it. The hours of study were long&mdash;eight
hours a day&mdash;and this upon lessons absolutely
meaningless.</p>

<p>The custom was in Boston&mdash;until this century&mdash;to
study through the grammar three times before
any application to parsing.</p>

<p>Far better wit than any found in an old-time jest
book was the sub-title of a very turgid Latin grammar,
"A delysious Syrupe newly Claryfied for
Yonge Scholars yt thurste for the Swete Lycore
of Latin Speche."</p>

<p>The first English Grammar used in Boston public
schools and retained in use till this century, was
<em>The Young Lady's Accidence, or a Short and Easy
Introduction to English Grammar, design'd principally
for the use of Young Learners, more especially for
those of the Fair Sex, though Proper for Either</em>. It
is said that a hundred thousand copies of it were
sold. It was a very little grammar about four or
five inches long and two or three wide, and had only
fifty-seven pages, but it was a very good little grammar
when compared with its fellows, being simple
and clearly worded.</p>

<p>The fashion of the day was to set everything in
rhyme as an aid to memory; and even so unpoetical
a subject as English Grammar did not escape the
rhyming writer. In the <cite>Grammar of the English
Tongue</cite>, a large and formidable book in fine type,
all the rules and lists of exceptions and definitions
were in verse. A single specimen, the definition of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[136]</a></span>
a letter, will show the best style of composition,
which, when it struggled with moods and tenses, was
absolutely meaningless.</p>

<div class="poem">
<span class="i0">"A Letter is an uncompounded Sound<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Of which there no Division can be Found,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Those Sounds to Certain Characters we fix,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Which in the English Tongue are Twenty-Six."<br /></span>
</div>

<p>The spelling of that day was wildly varied. <cite>Dilworth's
Speller</cite> was one of the earliest used, and the
spelling in it differed much from that of the
British Instructor. A third edition of <cite>The Child's
New Spelling Book</cite> was published in 1744. Famous
English lesson-books known among common folk
as "Readamadeasies," and book traders as "Reading
Easies"&mdash;really Reading made easy&mdash;belied
their name. Some had alphabets on two pages
because "One Alphabet is commonly worn out
before the Scholar is perfect in his Letters." It
is interesting to find "Poor Richard's" sayings in
these English books, but it is natural, too, when
we consider Franklin's popularity abroad, and know
that broadsides printed with his pithy and worldly-wise
maxims were found hanging on the wall of
many an English cottage.</p>

young verdent flowers, the cowslip,
daisy, primrose, and a thousand pleasing

the birds fill every grove with the
charming music of nature; love, tunes
their little voices, and they join in pairs

the days are at the longest. The flocks
and herds not being able to endure the
scorching heat of the sun, retire beneath
the shade of some spreading tree,
or the side of some cooling stream or
river. The wanton youths betake
themselves to the waters and swim with
pleasure over the liquid surface. Early
in the morning the careful mower
walks forth with his scythe on his
shoulder, and sometimes with a pipe in</p></div>
</div>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Not until the days of Noah Webster and his
famous Spelling Book and Dictionary was there
any decided uniformity of spelling. Professor Earle<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[137]</a></span>
says the process of compelling a uniform spelling
is a strife against nature. Certainly it took a long
struggle against nature to make spelling uniform in
America. In the same letter, men of high education
would spell the same word several different
ways. There was no better usage in England. The
edition of Milton's <cite>Paradise Lost</cite> printed in 1688
shows some very grotesque spelling. Therefore it
is not strange to find a New York teacher advertising
to teach "writeing and spilling."</p>

<p>To show that a fetich was made of spelling
seventy-five years ago, I give this extract from a
Danbury school notice:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"The advantages that small children obtain at this school
may be easily imagined when the public are informed that
those who spell go through the whole of Webster's spelling
book twice a fortnight."</p></blockquote>

<p>The teaching of spelling in many schools was peculiar.
The master gave out the word, with a blow
of his strap on the desk as a signal for all to start
together, and the whole class spelled out the word
in syllables in chorus. The teacher's ear was so
trained and acute that he at once detected any misspelling.
If this happened, he demanded the name
of the scholar who made the mistake. If there was
any hesitancy or refusal in acknowledgment, he kept<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[138]</a></span>
the whole class until, by repeated trials of long
words, accuracy was obtained. The roar of the
many voices of the large school, all pitched in different
keys, could be heard on summer days for
a long distance. In many country schools the
scholars not only spelled aloud but studied all their
lessons aloud, as children in Oriental countries do
to-day: and the teacher was quick to detect any
lowering of the volume of sound and would reprove
any child who was studying silently. Sometimes
the combined roar of voices became offensive
to the neighbors of the school, and restraining votes
were passed at town-meetings.</p>

<p>The colonial school and schoolmaster took a firm
stand on "cyphering." "The Bible and figgers is
all I want my boys to know," said an old farmer.
Arithmetic was usually taught without text-books.
Teachers had manuscript "sum-books," from which
they gave out rules and problems in arithmetic to
their scholars. Abraham Lincoln learned arithmetic
from a "sum-book" of which he made a neat copy.
A page from this sum-book is here given in reduced
size. Too often these sums were copied by the
pupil without any explanation of the process being
offered or rendered by the master. The artist
Trumbull recalled that he spent three weeks, unaided
in any way, over a single sum in long division.</p>

</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[139]</a></span></p>

<p>A manuscript sum-book in my possession is
marked, "Sarah Keeler her Book, May ye 1st, <small>A.D.</small>
1773, Ridgbury." There are multiplication examples
of fifteen figures multiplied by fifteen, and
long division examples of a dividend of quintillions,
chiefly in sevens and nines, divided by a mixed
divisor of billions in eights and fives&mdash;a thing to
make poor Sarah turn in her grave. There are
Reductions Ascending and Reductions Descending
and Reductions both Ascending and Descending
at the same time, as complicated as the computations
of the revolutions of the celestial spheres.
There are miserable catch-examples about people's
ages and others about collections of excises, with
"Proofs," and still others about I know not what,
for there are within their borders mysterious abbreviations
and signs, like some black magic. Sainted
Sarah Keeler! a melancholy sympathy settles on me
as I regard this book and all the extended sums
you knew, and think of the paths of pleasantness of
the present pupils of kindergartens; and wonder
what kind of a mathematical song or game or
allegory could be invented to disguise these very
"plain figures."</p>

<p>Sometimes a zealous teacher would write out
tables of measures and a few blind rules for his
scholars. This amateur arithmetic would be copied<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[140]</a></span>
and recopied until it was punctuated with mistakes.</p>

<p>Many scholars never saw a printed arithmetic;
and when the
master had one
for circulation
it was scarcely
more helpful
than the sum-book.
One of
the most ancient
arithmetics was
written by the
mathematician
Record, who
lived from the
year 1500 to
1558. He is
said to have invented
the sign
of equality =,
but there is nothing
in his book
to indicate this
fact. The terms
"arsemetrick"
and "augrime"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[141]</a></span>
are used in it, instead of arithmetic. Many curious
and obsolete rules are given, among them, "The
Golden Rule," "Rule of Falsehood," "The Redeeming
of Pawnes of Geams," "The Backer
Rule of Thirds." Here is a simple problem under
the latter:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"I did lend my friend <sup>3</sup>&frasl;<sub>4</sub> of a Porteguise 7 months
upon promise that he should do as much for me again,
and when I should borrow of him, he could lend me but
<sup>5</sup>&frasl;<sub>12</sub> of a Porteguese, now I demand how long time I
must keep his money in just Recompence of my loan,
accounting 13 months in the year."</p></blockquote>

<p>Rhyme is used in this book, in dialogues between
the master and scholar. Copies of <cite>Cocker's Arithmetick</cite>
are said to be very rare in England, but I
have seen several in America. An edition was published
in Philadelphia in 1779. The frontispiece
of English and American editions shows the picture
of the mathematician surrounded by a wreath of
laurel with the droll apostrophe:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem">
<span class="i0">"Ingenious Cocker! Now to Rest thou 'rt Gone<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Noe Art can Show thee fully but thine Own<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Thy rare <em>Arithmetick</em> alone can show<br /></span>
<span class="i1">What vast Sums of Thanks wee for Thy Labour owe."<br /></span>
</div>

<p>"Ingenious Cocker," as one would say "Most
noble Shakespeare!" It is hard indeed to idealize or
write poetical tributes to one by the name of Cocker.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[142]</a></span>
It gives us a sense of pleasant familiarity with any
one to know that he is "well acquaint" with one
of our intimate friends, so I feel much drawn to
ingenious Cocker by knowing that he was well
known of Sam Pepys. He was a writing master,
and did some mighty fine engraving for Pepys, who
calls him ingenuous, not ingenious. It is rather a
facer to learn from the notes in the Diary that
Cocker had nothing whatever to do with his Arithmetic,
which was a forgery by John Hawkins.</p>

<p>The age that would rhyme a grammar would
rhyme an arithmetic, and Record's example was
followed and enlarged upon. Thomas Hylles
published one in 1620, <cite>The Arte of Vulgar Arithmiteke</cite>,
written in dialogue, with the rules and
theorems in verse. This is an example of his
poesy:&mdash;</p>

<p>"<span class="smcap">The Partition of a Shilling into his Aliquot Partes</span>.</p>

<p>In 1633 Nicholas Hunt added to his rules and
tables an "Arithmetike-Rithmeticall or the Handmaid's
Song of Numbers," which rhymes are simply
unspeakable. These attempts did not end with the
seventeenth century. In 1801 Richard Vyse had
a <cite>Tutor's Guide</cite> with problems in rhyme.</p>

<div class="poem">

<span class="i1">Februarie eight and twentie alone, all the rest thirtie and one."<br /></span>

<p>is given by Halliwell as 1633. I have found it in
an old arithmetic printed in London in 1596. The
lines beginning "Multiplication is vexation," are not
an outburst of modern students. They are found
in a manuscript dated 1570 circa.</p>

<div class="poem">
<span class="i0">"Multiplication is mie vexation<br /></span>

<p>After the Revolution, in new and zealous Americanism,
text-books by American authors outsold
English books. The blue-backed spelling book of
Noah Webster drove Perry and Dilworth from the
field. Bingham and Webster took advantage of
the need of suitable school-books and divided the
field between them. Webster's Spelling Book outstripped
Bingham's <cite>Child's Companion</cite>, but Bingham's
Readers, such as <cite>The American Preceptor</cite> and
<cite>The Columbian Orator</cite> held their ground against
Webster's. Not one of Bingham's books proved
a failure. <cite>The Columbian Orator</cite> contained seven
extracts from speeches of Pitt in opposition to
the measures of George III., it had speeches by
Fox and Sheridan, part of the address of President
Carnot at the establishment of the French Republic,
and the famous speech of Colonel Barr&eacute;
on the Stamp Act.</p>

<p>Nicholas Pike of Newburyport, Massachusetts,
wrote an arithmetic that routed the English books
of Cocker and Hodder. It was studied by many
persons now living. It had three hundred and
sixty-three barren rules, and not a single explanation
of one of them. Many of them would now
be wholly unintelligible to scholars, though no more
antiquated than are the methods; for instance, this
rule in Tare and Trett:&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[145]</a></span></p>

<blockquote>

<p>"Deduct the Tare and Trett. Divide the Suttle by
amount given; the Quotient will be the Cloff which
subtract from the Suttle the Remainder will be the
Neat."</p></blockquote>

<p>The tables of measures were longer than ours
to-day; in measuring liquids were used the terms
anchors, tuns, butts, tierces, kilderkins, firkins, puncheons,
etc. In dry measure were pottles, strikes,
cooms, quarters, weys, lasts. Examples in currency
were in pounds, shillings, and pence; and doubtless
helped to retain the use of these terms in daily trade
long after dollars had been coined in America. This
labored book, aided by the flattering testimonials
of Governor Bowdoin, of the Presidents of Harvard,
Yale, and Dartmouth Colleges, and of that
idolized American, George Washington, gained wide
acceptance.</p>

<p>I have examined with care a <cite>Wingate's Arithmetic</cite>
printed in 1620, which was used for over a
century in the Winslow family in Massachusetts.
"Pythagoras his Table," is, of course, our multiplication
table. Then comes, the "Rule of Three,"
the "double Golden Rule," the "Rule of Fellowship,"
the "Rule of False," etc., etc., ending with
"Pastimes, a collection of pleasant and polite Questions
to exercise all the parts of Vulgar Arithmetick."
Here is one:&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[146]</a></span></p>

<blockquote>

<p>"This Problem is usually propounded in this manner,
viz. fifteen <em>Christians</em> and fifteen <em>Turks</em> being at Sea in one
and the same Ship in a terrible Storm, &amp; the Pilot declaring
a necessity of casting the one half of those Persons into the
Sea, that the rest might be saved; they all agreed that the
persons to be cast away should be set out by lot after this
manner, viz. the thirty persons should be placed in a round
form like a <em>Ring</em>, and then beginning to count at one of the
Passengers, and proceeding circularly, every ninth person
should be cast into the Sea, until of the thirty persons there
remained only fifteen. The question is, how those thirty
persons ought to be placed, that the lot might infallibly fall
upon the fifteen <em>Turks</em> &amp; not upon any of the fifteen <em>Christians</em>?
For the more easie remembering of the rule to
resolve this question shall presuppose the five vowels, a, e,
i, o, u, to signifie five numbers to wit, (a) one, (e) two, (i)
three, (o) four, and (u) five; then will the rule it self be
briefly comprehended in these two following verses:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem">
<span class="i0">From numbers, aid and art<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Never will fame depart.<br /></span>
</div>

<p>In which verses you are principally to observe the vowels,
with their correspondent numbers before assigned, and then
beginning with the <em>Christians</em> the vowel <em>o</em> (in <em>from</em>) signifieth
that four <em>Christians</em> are to be placed together; next unto
them, the vowel <em>u</em> (in <em>num</em>) signifieth that five <em>Turks</em> are to
be placed. In like manner <em>e</em> (in <em>bers</em>) denoteth 2 <em>Christians</em>,
<em>a</em> (in <em>aid</em>) 1 <em>Turk</em>, <em>i</em> (in <em>aid</em>) 3 <em>Christians</em>, <em>a</em> (in <em>and</em>) 1 <em>Turk</em>,
<em>a</em> (in <em>art</em>) 1 <em>Christian</em>, <em>e</em> (in <em>ne</em>) 2 <em>Turks</em>, <em>e</em> (in <em>ver</em>) 2 <em>Christians</em>,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[147]</a></span>
<em>i</em> (in <em>will</em>) 3 <em>Turks</em>, <em>a</em> (in <em>fame</em>) 1 <em>Christian</em>, <em>e</em> (in <em>fame</em>)
2 <em>Turks</em>, <em>e</em> (in <em>de</em>) 2 <em>Christians</em>, <em>a</em> (in <em>part</em>) 1 <em>Turk</em>.</p>

<p>"The invention of the said Rule and such like, dependeth
upon the subsequent demonstration, viz. if the
number of persons be thirty, let thirty figures or cyphers be
placed circularly or else in a right line as you see:&mdash;</p>

<p class="center">ooooooooooooooo."</p></blockquote>

<p>I trust the little Winslows and their neighbors
understood this sum, and its explanation, and that
the Christians were all saved, and the Turks were
all drowned.</p>

<p>Geography was an accomplishment rather than
a necessary study, and was spoken of as a diversion
for a winter's evening. Many objections were
made that it took the scholar's attention away from
"cyphering." It was not taught in the elementary
schools till this century. <cite>Morse's Geography</cite> was
not written till after the Revolution. It had a
mean little map of the United States, only a few
inches square. On it all the land west of the Mississippi
River was called Louisiana, and nearly all
north of the Ohio River, the Northwestern Territory.
Small as the book was, and meagre as was
its information, many of its pages were devoted to
short, stilted dialogues between a teacher and pupil,
in which the scholar was made to say such priggish
sentences:&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[148]</a></span></p>

<blockquote>

<p>"I am very thankful, sir, for your entertaining instruction,
and I shall never forget what you have been telling me.</p>

<p>"I long, sir, for to-morrow to come that I may hear more
of your information.</p>

<p>"I am truly delighted, sir, with the account you have
given me of my country. I wish, sir, it may be agreeable
to you to give me a more particular description of the
United States.</p>

<p>"I hope, sir, I have a due sense of your goodness to me.
I have, sir, very cheerfully, and I trust very profitably,
attended your instructions."</p></blockquote>

<p>A rather amusing <cite>Geographical Catechism</cite> was
published in 1796, by Rev. Henry Pattillo, a Presbyterian
minister of North Carolina, for the use
of the university students. It is properly and
Presbyterianly religious. It gives this explanation
of comets:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"Their uses are mere conjecture. Some judge them
the seats of punishment where sinners suffer the extremes
of heat and cold. Mr. Whiston says a comet approaching
the sun brushed the earth with its tail and caused the
deluge, and that another will cause the conflagration."</p></blockquote>

<p>Let us not be too eager to jeer at these ancient
school-books. Pope wrote nearly two centuries ago:</p>

<div class="poem">
<span class="i0">"Still is to-morrow wiser than to-day<br /></span>
<span class="i1">We think our fathers fools so wise we grow.<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Our wiser sons no doubt will think us so."<br /></span>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[149]</a></span></p>
<p>Perhaps the series of text-books which have
chased each other in and out of our nineteenth-century
public schools under the successive boards
of commissioners and school committees who have
also flashed briefly on our educational horizon,
may cut no better figure two centuries
hence than do those of
Lilly and Pike and
Cocker.</p>

<h3>PENMANSHIP AND LETTERS</h3>

<div class="stanza">
<span class="i4">&mdash;<cite>A New Book of Hands, 1650 circa.</cite><br /></span>
</div></div>


<p>In glancing over old school contracts it will be
noted that in a majority of cases the teacher is
specified as a writing-master; without doubt
the chief requisite of a satisfactory teacher in colonial
days was that he should be a good teacher of
penmanship.</p>

<p>We have seen in our own day distinct changes in
the handwriting of an entire generation; the colonists
whose lives ended with the seventeenth century
had a characteristic handwriting which retained certain
elements of old English, even of medi&aelig;val
script. It was a handsome and dignified chirography
and an impressive one, and was usually easy to read.
The writing of the first Pilgrim and Puritan fathers
was not over-good. Governor John Winthrop's<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[151]</a></span>
was not much better than Horace Greeley's. Bradford's
we are familiar with through the beautiful facsimiles
of his <cite>Relation</cite>.</p>

<p>The first half of the succeeding century did not
send forth such good writers; nor did it send forth
writers so universally; the proportion of signatures
to public documents by cross instead of writing increased.
Our grandparents and great-grandparents
all wrote well. In hundreds of century-old letters
which I have examined an ill-written letter is an
exception. Children at the close of the eighteenth
century wrote beautifully rounded, clear, and
uniform hands, if we can judge from their copy-books.
Little Anna Green Winslow, writing in
1771, showed page after page in a hand far better
than that of most girls of her age to-day.</p>

<p>Claude Blanchard was commissary of supplies for
the French army which landed in Newport in 1780.
He visited the Newport school and gave this tribute
to the scholars:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"I saw the writing of these children, it appeared to
me to be handsome; among others that of a young girl
nine or ten years old, very pretty and very modest, and
such as I would like my own daughter to be when she is
so old; she was called Abigail Earle, as I perceived upon
her copy-book, on which her name was written. I wrote
it myself, adding to it 'very pretty.'"</p></blockquote>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[152]</a></span></p>

<p>An "exhibition piece" is here given of the penmanship
of Anne Reynolds, a little girl of Norwich,
Connecticut, who died shortly after this "piece" was
written.</p>

<p>Writing-masters were universally honored in
every community. A part of the funeral notice of
one in Boston, who died in 1769, reads thus:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"Last Friday morning died Mr. Abiah Holbrook in
this town. He was looked upon by the best Judges as the
Greatest Master of the pen we ever had among us, of
which he has left a beautiful Demonstration."</p></blockquote>

<p>This "beautiful demonstration" of his penmanship
was a most intricate piece of what was known
as fine knotting, or knotwork. It was said to be
"written in all the known hands of Great Britain,"
and was valued at &pound;100. It was bequeathed to
Harvard College unless it was bought by the Revolutionary
patriot, John Hancock, who had been one
of Master Holbrook's pupils and, as we know from
the fine bold signature of his own name to the
Declaration of Independence, was a very creditable
scholar.</p>

<img src="images/i052.jpg" width="451" height="600" alt="exhibition" />
<div class="caption"><p class="center">Exhibition "Piece" of Anne Reynolds</p></div>
</div>

<p>This work had occupied every moment of what
Abiah Holbrook called his "spare time" for seven
years. As he had, in the year 1745, two hundred
and twenty scholars at one time in one school, his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[153]</a></span>
spare time must have been very short. He and
other writing-masters of the Holbrook family left
behind a still nobler demonstration than this knotwork
in the handwriting of their scholars&mdash;Boston
ministers, merchants, statesmen, and patriots&mdash;whose
elegant penmanship really formed a distinct
style, and was known as "Boston Style of Writing."</p>

<p>The "hands of Great Britain" were many in
number; among them Saxon, Old Mss., Chancery,
Gothic, Running Court, Exchequer, Pipe Office,
Engrossing, Running Secretary, Round Text, and
the "Lettre Frisee," which was minutely and regularly
zigzagged.</p>

<p>A well-known Boston writing-master was familiarly
known as Johnny Tileston. He was born in
1738 and taught till 1823, when he was pensioned
off. He was a rough-mannered old fellow; his
chief address to the scholars being the term, "You
gnurly wretch." His ideal was his own teacher,
Master Proctor, and when late in life he saw a
scholar wipe his pen on a bit of cloth, he approached
the desk, lifted the rag and said, "What's this?
Master Proctor had no such thing." Tileston himself
always wiped his pens with his little finger and
in turn dried his finger on his own white hairs under
his wig. An old spelling-book has these lines for a
"writing-copy ":&mdash;</p>

<p>In olden times but one kind of a pen was used,
one cut from a goose-quill with the feathers left
on the handle. The selection
and manufacture of these goose-quill
pens was a matter of considerable
care in the beginning,
and of constant watchfulness
and "mending" till the pen
was worn out. One of the
indispensable qualities of a colonial
schoolmaster was that he
was a good pen maker and pen
mender. It often took the
master and usher two hours to make the pens for
the school. Boys studied arithmetic at eleven years
of age, but were not allowed to make pens in school
till they were twelve years old.</p>

<p>Ink was not bought in convenient liquid form as
at present; each family, each person had to be an
ink manufacturer. The favorite method of ink-making
was through the dissolving of ink-powder.
Liquid ink was but seldom seen for sale. In
remote districts of Vermont, Maine, and Massachusetts,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[155]</a></span>
home-made ink, feeble and pale, was made by
steeping the bark of swamp-maple in water, boiling
the decoction till thick, and diluting it with copperas.
Each child brought to school an ink-bottle or ink-horn
filled with the varying fluid of domestic manufacture.</p>

<div class="caption"><p class="center">Writing of Abiah Holbrook</p></div>
</div>

<p>A book called <cite>The District School</cite>, written as late
as 1834, shows the indifferent quality of the ink
used. The writer complains that the parents made
a poor ink of vinegar, water, and ink-powder, which
the child could not use, and permitted to dry up
while he borrowed of the teacher. The inkstand is
then "used at the evening meetings as a candlestick."
Other inkstands with good ink are seized
and used for the same purpose and the ink ruined
with grease and nothing left to write with when the
teacher sets his scholars to work.</p>

<p>There are no remains of olden times that put us
more closely in touch with the men, women, and
children who moved and lived in these shadowy
days than do the letters they wrote. Old James
Howell said over two centuries ago: "Letters are
the Idea and the truest Miror of the Mind; they
shew the Inside of a Man." Certainly the most
imaginative mind must be touched with a sense of
nearness to the heart of the writer whose yellowed
pages he unfolds and whose fading words he deciphers.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[156]</a></span>
The roll of centuries cannot dim the
power of written words.</p>

<p>In the Prince Library, in Boston, are the manuscripts
known under the various titles of the
<cite>Mather Papers</cite>, the <cite>Cotton Papers</cite>, the <cite>Torrey Papers</cite>,
etc. They are delightful to see and to read, for the
ink is still clear and black, the paper firm and good,
the letters well-formed, and the text breathes a spirit
of kindness, affection, and loving thoughtfulness
that speaks of the beauty of Puritan home life.
Some of the letters are written by Puritan women;
and these letters are uniformly well spelt, well written,
and intelligent. Perhaps only intelligent women
were taught to write. These letters are on fine
Dutch paper; there was no English writing-paper
till the time of William and Mary. They are
carefully folded with due regard to the etiquette of
letter-folding, and plainly and neatly addressed.</p>

<p>The letters are very tender and gentle; sometimes
they are written to children; they begin,
"My deare Child"; "My Indear'd Sonn"; "To
my dearly loved Friend and Child." One ends,
"With my Indeared Love, committing thyself and
thy duty and service to all our friends, and to
the protection of the Almighty, I am thine." A
mother addresses on the outside her letter to her
son in these words, "To my very good friend,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[157]</a></span>
These Present," etc. John Cotton addresses a
letter externally thus: "These, For the Reverend,
his very deare Brother, Mr. Increase Mather,
Teacher of a Church at Boston, Present." Sometimes
the address ran, "Messenger present these to,
etc." Hence it may be seen that the word "Present"
sometimes seen on modern letters properly is the
imperative verb Present. Occasionally the words
"Haste! post haste!" were seen, as on English
letters, but I have never seen the old postal inscription,
"Haste! post, haste! on your Life! on your
Life!"</p>

<p>A very genuine and pleasing letter was written by
John Quincy Adams when he was nine years old
to his father, President John Adams:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p class="sig">
"<span class="smcap">Braintree</span>, June the 2nd, 1777.
</p>

<p>"<span class="smcap">Dear Sir</span>: I love to receive letters very well, much
better than I love to write them. I make but a poor figure
at composition, my head is much too fickle, my thoughts
are running after bird's eggs, play, and trifles till I get
vexed with myself. I have but just entered the 3rd vol
of Smollett tho' I had design'd to have got it half through
by this time. I have determined this week to be more
diligent, as Mr. Thaxter will be absent at Court, &amp; I cannot
persue my other studies. I have set myself a Stent &amp;
determine to read the 3rd Volume Half out. If I can but
keep my resolution, I will write again at the end of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[158]</a></span>
week and give a better account of myself. I wish, Sir,
you would give me some instructions with regard to my
time &amp; advise me how to proportion my Studies &amp; my
Play, in writing I will keep them by me &amp; endeavour to
follow them. I am, dear Sir, with a present determination
of growing better yours. P.S. Sir, if you will be so good
as to favour me with a Blank Book, I will transcribe the
most remarkable occurrences I meet with in my reading
which will serve to fix them upon my mind."</p></blockquote>

<p>We cannot wonder at the precision and elegance
of the letter-writing of our forbears, when we know
the "painful" precepts of parents in regard to their
children's penmanship and composition. In the
letters written by Ephraim Williams, a plain New
England farmer, from his home in Stockbridge in
the years 1749 <em>et seq.</em> to his son Elijah, while the
latter was in Princeton College, is shown the respect
felt for a good handwriting. Nearly every letter
had some such sentences as these:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"I would intreet you to endeavour daily to Improve
yourself in writting and spelling; they are very ornimentall
to a scholar and the want of them is an exceeding great
Blemish."</p>

<div class="figcenter bord" style="width: 371px;"><a name="waite" id="waite"></a>
<img src="images/i055.jpg" width="371" height="550" alt="Waite" />
<div class="caption"><p class="center">David Waite, Seven Years Old</p></div>
</div>

<p>"I desire you would observe in your Wrighting to make
proper Distances between words; don't blend your words
together use your utmost endeavours to spell well; consult
all Rules likely to help you; Such words as require<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[159]</a></span>

every day all Opportunities you can possibly get. Observe

it may be of service to you: you can scarce conceive
what a vast disadvantage it will be to leave the Colledg and
not be able to write and spell well. Learn to write a pretty
fine Hand as you may have Ocation."</p></blockquote>

<p>He urges him to study the spelling rules laid
down in the <cite>Youth's Instructor in the English Tounge</cite>,
and tells him not to follow his (the father's) writing
for an example as he has "but common English
learning." He reproves, admonishes, and finally
says Elijah's sisters will prove better scholars than
he is if he does not have a care, which was a bitter
taunt.</p>

<p>Major Dulany of Maryland wrote to his little
daughter some very intelligent advice, of which these
lines are a portion:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"In letter writing as in conversation it will be found that
those who substitute the design of distinguishing themselves
for that of giving pleasure to those whom they address must
ever fail. Having decided upon what is proper to be said
accustom yourself to express it in the best possible manner.
Always use the words that most exactly correspond with
the ideas you mean to express. There are fewer synonymous
words in our language than is generally supposed, as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[160]</a></span>
you will find in looking over your Dictionary. It has been
remembered upon as a great excellence of Gen'l Washington's
writings that no one could substitute a single word
which could so well express his meaning. I have heard
(whether it be true or not I cannot say) that for seven
years of his life he never wrote without having his Dictionary
before him."</p></blockquote>

<p>The letters of Aaron Burr, written at a little later
period to his beloved daughter Theodosia, show as
unvarying and incessant pains to form perfection in
letter-writing, as was displayed by Lord Chesterfield
in his letters to his son. When she was but ten or
twelve we find Burr giving her minute instruction
as to her penmanship; its size, shape, the formation
of sentences, the spelling, the exact use of synonyms.
He sends her sentences bidding her return
them in a more elegant form, to translate them into
Latin. He exhorts her to study the meaning, use,
and etymology of every word in his letter. He has
her keep for him a daily journal written in a narrative
style. Even when on trial for treason in 1808
he still instructed her, reproving her for her negligent
failure to acknowledge letters received. He
commended her style, saying she had energy and
aptitude of expression; altogether I can fancy no
rule of correct epistolary conduct left unsaid by Burr
to his daughter. That he had a high opinion of her<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[161]</a></span>
powers we cannot doubt; but the specimens of her
composition that exist show no great brilliancy or
originality.</p>

<p>As books multiplied after the Revolution, many
letters were modelled on effusions that had been
seen and admired in print: this at a loss of much
naturalness and quaintness of expression. Letter-writing
guides formed the most pernicious influence.
Miss Stoughton of East Windsor inviting sprightly
Nancy Williams of East Hartford to a gay party
began her note in this surprising way: "Worthy
Lady."</p>

<p>Children (and grown people too) had a very reprehensible
habit of scribbling in their books. Of
course each owner wrote his name, with more or less
elegance and accompanying flourishes, according to
his capacity. Some very valuable autographs have
by this means been preserved. A single title-page
will often bear the names of several owners. They
also wrote various rhymes and sentiments, which
might be gathered under the head of title-page lore.</p>

<p>The most ancient rhyme I have seen is dated
1635 and is in an ancient <cite>Cocker's Arithmetic</cite>:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem">
<span class="i0">"John Greene (or Graves), his book<br /></span>
<span class="i1">God give Him Grace theirein to look<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Not oneley to look, but to Understand<br /></span>
<span class="i1">That Larning is better than House or Land."<br /></span>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[162]</a></span></p>
<p>This rhyme is frequently seen, sometimes with
the added lines:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem">
<span class="i0">"When Land is Gone and Money Spent<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Then Larning is most excellent.<br /></span>
<span class="i9">If this you See<br /></span>
<span class="i9">Remember Me."<br /></span>
</div>

<p>Another rhyme is:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem">
<span class="i0">"Steal not this Book for if You Do<br /></span>
<span class="i1">The Devil will be after You.<br /></span>
</div>

<p>Longer and more formal rhymes are found in the
books of older owners. Occasionally a child's book
had a valentine sentiment, or a riddle, or a drawing
of hearts and darts; crude pictures of Indians and
horses are many. I have seldom found verses from
the Bible or religious sentiments written in childish
hands. Whether this is the result of profound respect
or of indifference I cannot tell. As a special
example of book scribbling, one of historical interest
is given, a page of the famous "White Bible,"
which contains the entry, much disputed
of genealogical and historical societies,
that John Howland married
Governor Carver's
"grand-darter."</p>

<p>Grown folk had in colonial days a habit
of keeping diaries and making notes in
interleaved almanacs, but they are not of
great value to the historian; for they are not what
Wordsworth declared such compositions should be,
namely, "abundant in observation and sparing of
reflection." They are instead barren of accounts
of happenings, and descriptions of surroundings,
and are chiefly devoted to weather reports and
moral and religious reflections, both original and in
the form of sermon and lecture notes. The note-taking<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[164]</a></span>
habit of Puritan women was held up by such
detractors as Bishop Earle as one of their most
contemptible traits. To-day we can simply deplore
it as having been such a vain thing; for it is certainly
true, no matter how deeply religious in feeling
any one of the present day may be, that to the
modern mind a long course of the pious sentiments
and religious aspirations of others is desperately tiresome
reading. Such records were not tiresome,
however, to those of Puritan faith; there were but
few old-time diaries which were not composed on
those lines. The chief exception is that historical
treasure-house, Judge Sewall's diary, which shows
plainly, also, the deep religious feeling of its author.
Another of more restricted interest, but of value, is
that of Dr. Parkman, the Westborough minister.
Governor Winthrop's <cite>History</cite> has much of the diary
element in it. Naturally, the diaries of children
copied in quality and wording those of their elders.
A unique exception in these youthful records is the
journal of a year or two of the life of a Boston
schoolgirl, Anna Green Winslow. Fortunately,
little Anna's desire to report the sermons she had
heard at the Old South Church, and to moralize
in ambitious theological comments thereon, was
checked by the sensible aunt with whom she lived,
who said, "A Miss of 12 years cant possibly do<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[165]</a></span>
justice to nice Subjects in Divinity, and therefore
had better not attempt a repetition of particulars."
We, therefore, have a story of her life, not of her
thoughts; and many references to her diary appear
in this volume.</p>

<div class="caption"><p class="center">Anna Green Winslow</p></div>
</div>

<p>It is curious and interesting to note how Puritan
traits and habits lingered in generation after generation,
and outlived change of environment and mode
of living. In 1630, Rev. John White of Dorchester,
England, brought out a Puritan colony which
settled in Massachusetts, and named the village Dorchester,
after their English home. In 1695, a group
of the descendants of these settlers once more emigrated
to "Carolina." Tradition asserts that they
were horrified at the persecution of witches in Massachusetts.
Upham names one Daniel Andrew as a
man who protested so vigorously against the prevailing
folly and persecution, that he was compelled to
fly to South Carolina. Thomas Staples was fearless
enough to sue and obtain judgment against the
Deputy Governor for saying Goodwife Staples was
a witch, and members of his family went also to
South Carolina.</p>

<p>With loyalty to their two Dorchester homes, a
third Dorchester, in South Carolina, was named.
They built a good church which is still standing,
though the village has entirely disappeared, and the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[166]</a></span>
site is overgrown with large trees. Indian wars, poor
government, church oppression, and malaria once
more drove forth these undaunted Puritans to found
a fourth Dorchester in Georgia. In 1752, they left
in a body, took up a grant of twenty-two thousand
acres in St. John's Parish, and formed the Midway
Church. Their meeting-house was headquarters for
the Whigs during the Revolution, was burned by
the British, rebuilt in 1790, and is still standing.
In it meetings are held every spring by hundreds
of the descendants of its early members, though it
is remote from railroads, and swamps and pine barrens
have taken the place of smiling rice and cotton
fields.</p>

<p>Stories of the rigidity of church government of
these people still exist. The tradition of one child
who smiled in Midway Church was for generations
held up with horror, "as though she had hoofs and
horns." There attended this church a descendant
of both Andrew and Staples, the scoffers at witches,
one Mary Osgood Sumner. She had a short and
sad life. Married at eighteen she was a widow at
twenty, and with her sister, Mrs. Holmes (an
aunt of Oliver Wendell Holmes), and another
sister, Anne, sailed from Newport to New York,
"and were never heard of more."</p>

<p>She left behind her sermon notes and a "Monitor,"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[167]</a></span>
or diary, which had what she called a black
list of her childish wrong-doings, omissions of duty,
etc., while the white list showed the duties she performed.
Though she was evidently absolutely conscientious
these are the only entries on the "Black
Leaf":&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
"July 8. I left my staise on the bed.<br />
<br />

<p>Not a very heinous list.</p>

<p>Here are entries from the good page of her little
"Monitor":&mdash;</p>

<p>I have given this record of this monotonous
young life in detail, simply to prove the simplicity
of the daily round of a child's life at that time.
The pages prove with equal force the domination of
the Puritan temperament, a nervous desire and intent
to be good, and industrious, and attentive, and helpful.
We seldom meet that temperament in children
nowadays; and when we do it is sure to be,
as in this case, a Puritan inheritance.</p>

<p>John Quincy Adams, when eleven years old,
determined to write a Journal, and he thus lucidly
and sensibly explains his intentions to his mother:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"<span class="smcap">Honoured Mamma</span>: My Pappa enjoins it upon me
to keep a journal, or diary of the Events that happen to
me, and of objects I see, and of Characters that I converse
with from day to day; and altho' I am convinced of the
utility, importance, &amp; necessity of this Exercise, yet I have
not patience &amp; perseverance enough to do it so Constantly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[170]</a></span>
as I ought. My Pappa, who takes a great deal of Pains to put
me in the right way, has also advised me to Preserve copies
of all my letters, and has given me a Convenient Blank
Book for this end; and altho' I shall have the mortification
a few years hence to read a great deal of my Childish nonsense,
yet I shall have the Pleasure and advantage of Remarking
the several steps by which I shall have advanced
in taste judgment and knowledge. A journal Book &amp; a letter
Book of a Lad of Eleven years old can not be expected to
contain much of Science, Litterature, arts, wisdom or wit,
yet it may serve to perpetuate many observations that I may
make &amp; may hereafter help me to recolect both Persons &amp;
things that would other ways escape my memory.... My
father has given me hopes of a Pencil &amp; Pencil Book in
which I can make notes upon the spot to be transferred
afterwards to my Diary, and my letters, this will give me
great pleasure, both because it will be a sure means of improvement
to myself &amp; make me to be more entertaining to
you.</p>

<p>I believe this diary, so carefully decided upon,
does not now exist. The Adams family preserved a
vast number of family papers, but this was not among
them. I am sorry; for I find John Quincy Adams
a very pleasing child. When he was about seven
years old, his father was away from home as a delegate<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[171]</a></span>
to a Congress in Philadelphia which sought to
secure unity of action among the rebellious colonies.
His patriotic mother taught her boy in their retreat
at Braintree to repeat daily each morning, with
the Lord's Prayer, Collins' inspiring ode beginning,
"How sleep the brave who sink to rest," etc. Later
in life Adams wrote to a Quaker friend:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"For the space of twelve months my mother with her
infant children dwelt, liable every hour of the day and of
the night to be butchered in cold blood, or taken and carried
into Boston as hostages. My mother lived in unintermitted
danger of being consumed with them all in a conflagration
kindled by a torch in the same hands which on the seventeenth
of June (1775) lighted the fires of Charlestown. I
saw with my own eyes those fires, and heard Britannia's
thunders in the Battle of Bunker Hill, and witnessed the
tears of my mother and mingled them with my own."</p></blockquote>

<p>The mother took her boy by the hand and
mounted a height near their home and showed him
the distant signs of battle. Thus she fixed an impression
of a war for liberty on his young memory.
Two years later, to relieve her anxious and tedious
waiting for intelligence from her husband, the boy
became "post rider" for her between Braintree and
Boston, which towns were eleven miles apart&mdash;not
a light or easy task, for the nine-year-old boy with
the unsettled roads and unsettled times. The spirit<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[172]</a></span>
of patriotism which filled the mind of all grown folk
was everywhere reflected in the minds of the children.
Josiah Quincy was at school in Andover from
1778 to 1786, and he stated that he and his schoolmates
had as a principle, as a schoolboy law, that
every hoop, sled, etc., should in some way bear
<em>thirteen</em> marks. This was evidence of the good
political character of the owner; and if the marks
were wanting the article was contraband, was seized
and forfeited without judge, jury, or power of appeal.</p>

<p>Besides journal keeping, folks of that day had a useful
custom of keeping a commonplace book; that is,
they wrote out in a blank-book memorable sentences
or words which attracted their attention or admiration
in the various books they read, or made abstracts
or notes of the same. Cotton Mather tells of such
note making by young students. This writing out
of aphorisms, statements, etc., not only fixed them
in the memory, but kept them where the memory, if
faulty, could easily be assisted. It also served as
practice in penmanship. A verb, to commonplace,
came from this use of the word. The biography of
Francis North, Baron Guildford, gave an account
which explains fully commonplacing:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"It was his lordship's constant practice to commonplace
as he read. He had no bad memory but was diffident<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[173]</a></span>
and would not trust it. He acquired a very small but
legible hand, for where contracting is the main business (of
law) it is not well to write as the fashion now is, in uncial
or semi-uncial letters to look like a pig's ribs. His writing
on his commonplaces was not by way of index but epitome:
because he used to say the looking over a commonplace
book on any occasion gave him a sort of survey of what he
had read about matters not then inquisited, which refreshed
them somewhat in his memory."</p></blockquote>

<p>People invented methods of keeping commonplace
books and gave rules and instructions in commonplacing.
I have seen several commonplace
books, made by children of colonial times; pathetic
memorials, in every case, of children who died in
early youth. Tender and loving hearts have saved
those little unfinished records of childish reading,
after the way of mothers and fathers till the present
day, whose grieved affections cannot bear the
thought even of reverent destruction of the irregular
writing of a dearly loved child whose hands
are folded in death. One of these books with
scantily filled pages was tied with a number of
note-books of an old New England minister, and in
the father's handwriting on the first leaf were these
words:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"Fifty years ago died my little John. A child of
promise. Alas! alas! January 10th, 1805."</p></blockquote>

<p>The matter read by those children is clearly indicated
by their commonplace books. One entry shows
evidence of light reading. It is of riddles which
are headed "Guesses"; they are the ones familiar
to us all in <cite>Mother Goose's Melodies</cite> to-day. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[175]</a></span>
answers are written in a most transparent juvenile
shorthand. Thus the answer, "Well," is indicated
by the figures 23, 5, 12, 12, referring to the position
of the letters in the alphabet.</p>

<p>The usual entries are of a religious character;
extracts from sermons, answers from the catechism,
verses of hymns, accompany stilted religious
aspirations and appeals. In them a painful
familiarity with and partiality for
quotations bearing on hell and the
devil show the religious
teaching of the
times.</p>

<p>The seventeenth century was in Europe a
period of eager development and hasty harvesting;
English boys were made serious-minded
by the conditions they saw around them,
as well as by a forcing-house system of education,
begun at very early years. This early ageing is
reflected in the writings of the times. The
<cite>Religio Medici</cite>, apparently the composition of a man
of the large experience and serene contemplation of
extreme age, was written by Sir Thomas Browne
when he was but thirty.</p>

</div>

<p>There are many records of the precocity of children,
preserved for us many times, alas! through
the sad recounting of early deaths. One of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[177]</a></span>
most pathetic records of a father's blasted hopes
may be found in the pages of the diary of John
Evelyn. In December, 1658, died his little son,
Richard, five years and three days old. He was a
prodigy of wit and learning, as beautiful as an angel,
and of rare mental endowment. His father's account
of his acquirements runs thus:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"He had learned all his catechism at two years and a
half old; he could perfectly read any of the English, Latin,
French, or Gothic letters, pronouncing the first three languages
exactly. He had, before the fifth year, or in that
year, not only skill to read most written hands, but to
decline all the nouns, conjugate the verbs regular, and
most of the irregular; learned out Puerelis, got by heart
almost the entire vocabulary of Latin and French primitives
and words, could make congruous syntax, turn English into
Latin, and vice versa, construe and prove what he read,
and did the government and use of relatives, verbs, substantives,
ellipses and many figures and tropes, and made
a considerable progress in Comenius' Janua; begun himself
to write legibly and had a strong passion for Greek.
The number of verses he could recite was prodigious, and
what he remembered of the parts of plays which he would
also act; and, when seeing a Plautus in one's hand, he
asked what book it was, and being told it was comedy and
too difficult for him, he wept for sorrow. Strange was his
apt and ingenious application of fables and morals, for he
had read &AElig;sop; he had a wonderful disposition to mathematics,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[178]</a></span>
having by heart divers propositions of Euclid
that were read to him in play, and he would make lines
and demonstrate them. He had learned by heart divers
sentences in Latin and Greek which on occasion he would
produce even to wonder. He was all life, all prettiness,
far from morose, sullen, or childish in any thing he said
or did."</p></blockquote>

<p>Of course this is not given as an ordinary education
of an every-day child. It is an extraordinary
record of a very unusual child, but it shows what
an intelligent child could be permitted to do.
Evelyn was a man of great good sense; not the
sort of man who would force a child; indeed he
averred that he abhorred precocity. But in truth
it was a time in England's history when such a
child could easily be overstimulated, when public
events, the course of history, was so exciting that
every child of keen wit must have felt the effects.</p>

<p>The crowding of young minds did not end with
the seventeenth century. A striking example of the
desire to press education is found in the letters of
Lord Chesterfield to his son, beginning in 1738,
when the boy was not six years old. The language
and subjects would be deemed to-day suited only to
mature minds. In 1741 the father wrote:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"This is the last letter I shall write to you as a little
boy, for to-morrow you will attain your ninth year; so that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[179]</a></span>
for the future, I shall treat you as a youth. You must
now commence a different course of life, a different course of
studies. No more levity. Childish toys and playthings
must be thrown aside, and your mind directed to serious
objects. What was not unbecoming to a child would be
disgraceful to a youth" etc.</p></blockquote>

<p>Letter after letter continued in this tone. For
years was the process carried on. The result was a
striking proof of the futility of such methods. The
son died when but little past his youth, a failure in
everything the father had most fondly desired and
striven for. The crowded brain ever stumbled and
hesitated when put to any important test.</p>

<p>It was inevitable that New England parents, with
their fairly passionate intensity of zeal for the education
of their children, should in many cases overstimulate
and force the infant minds in their charge.
It seems somewhat anomalous with the almost universal
distrust and hindrance of female education
that one of the most precocious flowers of Puritanism
should have been a girl, the "pious and ingenious
Mrs. Jane Turell," who was born in Boston in
1708. Before her second year was finished she
could speak distinctly, knew her letters, and "could
relate many stories out of the Scriptures to the
satisfaction and pleasure of the most judicious."
Governor Dudley and other "wise and polite"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[180]</a></span>
New England gentlemen were among those entitled
"judicious," who placed her on a table to show
off her acquirements. When she was three years
old she could recite the greater part of the <cite>Assembly's
Catechism</cite>, many of the psalms, many lines
of poetry, and read distinctly; at the age of four she
"asked many astonishing questions about divine
mysteries."</p>

<p>As her father was President of Harvard College,
it may be inferred she had an extended reading
course; but in a catalogue of Harvard College
library printed a year or two later there is not a
title in it of any of the works of Addison, or any
of the poems of Pope, nothing of Dryden, Steele,
Young, or Prior. In 1722, when Jane Turell was
twenty years old, the works of Shakespeare were
first advertised for sale in Boston.</p>

</div>

<p>In many families of extreme Puritanical thought,
the children developed at an early age a comprehension
of religious matters which would seem abnormal
to-day, but was natural then. A striking instance
of this youthful development (as he was of highly
sensitive thought of every description) was Jonathan
Edwards. A letter of his written when he was
twelve years old is certainly precocious in its depth,
though there is a certain hint of humor in it. Some
one had stated the belief that the soul was material<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[181]</a></span>
and remained in the body until after the resurrection.
Young Edwards wrote:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"I am informed y<sup>t</sup> you have advanced a notion y<sup>t</sup> the
soul is material and keeps w<sup>t</sup>h y<sup>e</sup> body till y<sup>e</sup> resurrection.
As I am a profest lover of novelty you must alow me to
be much entertained by this discovery. 1<sup>s</sup>t. I w<sup>d</sup> know
whether this material soul keeps w<sup>t</sup>h in ye Coffin, and if so
whether it might not be convenient to build a repository
for it in order w<sup>c</sup>h I w<sup>d</sup> know w<sup>t</sup> shape it is of whether
round, triangular or foresquare or whether it is a number
of long fine strings reaching from y<sup>e</sup> head to y<sup>e</sup> foot, and
whether it does not live a very discontented life. I am
afraid when ye Coffin gives way ye Earth will fall in and
crush it, but if it should chuse to live above Ground and
hover above y<sup>e</sup> Grave how big it is, whether it covers all ye
body, or is assined to y<sup>e</sup> Head or Breast, w<sup>t</sup> it does when
another Body is laid upon it. Souls are not so big but y<sup>t</sup>
10 or a dozen of y<sup>m</sup> may be about one body whether yy
will not quarrill for y<sup>e</sup> highest place."</p></blockquote>

<p>His paper on spiders, written when he was but
twelve, has become famous as a bit of childish composition.
It shows great habits of observance, care
in note-taking, and logical reasoning; and bears no
evidence of youth either in matter or manner.</p>

<p>A typical example of the spirit of the times in
regard to juvenile education is found in the letters
of Mrs. Pinckney. She writes to a friend:&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[182]</a></span></p>

<blockquote>

<p>"Shall I give you the trouble my dear Madam to buy
my son a new toy (a description of which I inclose) to
teach him according to Mr. Locke's method (which I
have carefully studied) to play himself into learning. Mr.
Pinckney (his father) himself has been contriving a sett
of toys to teach him his letters by the time he can speak.
You perceive we begin betimes for he is not yet four
months old."</p></blockquote>

<p>This toy may have been what is known to-day as
a set of alphabet blocks, a commonplace toy. Locke
speaks of a game of dice with letters with which
children could play a game like "royal-oak," and
through which they would learn to spell. He was
not the inventor of these "letter-dice," as is generally
asserted. It was a stratagem of Sir Hugh
Plat, fully explained and illustrated in his <cite>Jewel
House of Art and Nature</cite>, printed in London in
1653, a portion of a page of which is shown here.</p>

<p>The toy seems to have been a success, for the
following year Mrs. Pinckney writes to her sister:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"Your little nephew not yet two and twenty months
old prattles very intelligibly: he gives his duty to you and
thanks for the toys, and desires me to tell his Aunt Polly
that if she don't take a care and a great deal of pains in her
learning, he will soon be the best scholar, for he can tell
his letters in any book without hesitation, and begins to
spell before he is two years old."</p></blockquote>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[183]</a></span></p>

<p>This precocious infant, afterward General Charles
Cotesworth Pinckney of Revolutionary fame, declared
in his later life that this early teaching was
sad stuff, and that the haste to make him a very
clever fellow nearly made him a very stupid one.</p>

<p>Little Martha Laurens, born in Charleston, South
Carolina, in 1759, could, in her third year, "read

Joseph T. Buckingham declared that when he was

Catechism</cite>.</p>

<p>Boys entered the Boston Latin School when as
young as but six years and a half old. They began
to study Latin frequently when much younger.
Zealous and injudicious parents sometimes taught
infants but three years old to read Latin words as
soon as they could English ones. It redounds to
the credit of the scholarship of one of my kinsmen,
rather than to his good sense or good temper
(albeit he was a minister of the Gospel) that each
morning while he shaved, his little son, five years
of age, stood by his dressing-table, on a footstool,
and read Latin to his father, who had also a copy
of the same book open before him, that he might
note and correct the child's errors. And the child
when grown to old age told his children and
grandchildren that his father, angered at what he
deemed slowness of progress, frequent errors of
pronunciation, and poor attempts at translation,
would throw the book at the child, and once felled
him from the footstool to the floor.</p>

<p>It is told of Timothy Dwight, President of Yale
College, that he learned the alphabet at a single
lesson, and could read the Bible before he was four<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[185]</a></span>
years old, and taught it to his comrades. At the
age of six he was sent to the grammar school and
importuned his father to let him study Latin.
Being denied he studied through the Latin grammar
twice without a teacher, borrowing a book of
an older boy. He would have been prepared for
college when but eight years old, had not the
grammar school luckily discontinued and left him
without a teacher.</p>

<p>The curriculum at Harvard in olden times bore
little resemblance to that of to-day. Sciences were
unknown, and the requirements in mathematics
were meagre. Still a boy needed even then to be
clever to know enough Greek and Latin to enter
at eleven. Paul Dudley did so in 1686. His
father wrote to the president a quaint letter of
introduction:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"I have humbly to offer you a little, sober, and well-disposed
son, who, tho' very young, if he may have the
favour of admittance, I hope his learning may be tollerable:
and for him I will promise that by your care and my
care, his own Industry, and the blessing of God, this
mother the University shall not be ashamed to allow him
the place of a son&mdash;Appoint a time when he may be
examined."</p></blockquote>

<p>There were still younger college students. In
1799 there was graduated from Rhode Island College<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[186]</a></span>
(now Brown University) a boy named John
Pitman, who was barely fourteen.</p>

<p>There is no evidence that the early marriages,
that is, marriages of children and very young lads
and girls, which were far from rare in England
during the first years of our colonial life, ever
were permitted in the new world. Nor were they
as common at that date in England as during the
previous century, for there had been severe legislation
against them, especially against the youthful
marriages of poor folk.</p>

<p>Many have known of the juvenile weddings of
English princes and princesses and marriages by
proxy for reasons of state; but few know of these
unions being general among English people. An
interesting and authoritative book on this subject
was published in 1897 by the <em>Early English
Text Society</em>. Dr. Furnivall made a careful study
of the old court records of the town of Chester,
England, and published this account of trials and
law cases concerning child-marriages, divorces, ratifications,
troth-plights, affiliations, clandestine marriages,
and other kindred matters. It is, as the
editor says, a "most light-giving" volume. It
ranges over all classes, from people of wealth, the
manor owners and squires, to ale-house keepers,
farmers, cobblers, maids, and men. It tells of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[187]</a></span>
marriages of little children in their nurses' arms,
some but two or three years old, so young that
their baby tongues could not speak the words of
matrimony. Various arrangements, chiefly relating
to lands and maintenance, led to these marriages,
also a desire to evade the Crown's guardianship
of orphans. In one case, a "bigge damsell" of
twelve "intysed with two apples" a younger boy to
marry her. "The woman tempted me and I did
eat." One little bridegroom of three was held up
in the arms of an English clergyman, who coaxed
him to repeat the words of the service. Before it
was finished the child said he would learn no more
of his lesson that day. The parson answered, "You
must speak a little more and then go play yon."
The child-marriage of the Earl and Countess of
Essex in 1606, resulting in the poisoning of Sir
Thomas Overbury, and the Countess' marriage to
the Earl of Somerset, is a well-known historical
example of the unhappy result of such marriages.
The Earl of Anglesey's grandson was married
in 1673, when he was eight years old. Mary
Hewitt of Danton Basset was wedded in 1669,
when three years old. In 1672 John Evelyn was
present "at the marriage of Lord Arlington's only
daughter, a sweet child if there ever was any, aged
five, to the Duke of Grafton."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[188]</a></span></p>

<p>I have given the dates of these later child-marriages
to show that they were not unusual in
England long after America was settled. As late
as 1729 a little English girl of some wealth and but
nine years old was taken from her boarding school
by her guardian and married to his son. Very differently
did the upright New Englander regard the
duties of guardianship. A little girl named Rebecca
Cooper was left an orphan in early colonial days
at Salem, Massachusetts. She was "a verie good
match," an "inheritrice," and the sharp eyes of
Emanuel Downing and his wife were upon her to
"make a motion of marriage" for their son. Both
wrote to Governor Winthrop, Madam Downing's
brother, to gain his intercession in the matter,
though the maid had not been spoken to. Madam
wrote:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"The disposition of the mayde and her education with
Mrs. Endicott are hopefull, her person tollerable, the estate
very convenient, and that is the state of the business."</p></blockquote>

<p>Governor Endicott was the guardian and his
answering letter to Winthrop has a manly and
honorable ring which might well have sounded in
the ears of all English guardians.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[190]</a></span></p>

<p>It is pleasant to record that all this match-making
and machination came to naught. It would not
have been strange if Governor Winthrop had
deemed this girl old enough to be married. He
had been but seventeen years old himself when he
was married, but he was, so he writes, "a man in
stature and understanding." He evidently was of
the opinion that a child of fourteen or fifteen was
of mature years. When his son John was but
fourteen the governor made a will making the boy
the executor of it.</p>

<p>These child-marriages were not abolished in
America because maturity or majority was established
at a greater age; for up to the Revolution
boys reached man's estate at sixteen years of age,
became tax-payers, and served in the militia. Early
unions were controlled by restrictive laws, such as
the one enacted in Massachusetts in 1646, that no
female orphan during her minority should be given
in marriage by any one except with the approbation
of the majority of the selectmen of the town in
which she resided. Another privilege of the girl
orphan was that at fourteen she could choose
her own guardian. Thus were children
protected in the new world,
and their rights
conserved.</p>

<h3>OLDTIME DISCIPLINE</h3>

<p>The manner of oldtime children differed as
much from the carriage of children to-day
as the severe and arbitrary modes of discipline
of colonial days differed from the persuasive explanations,
the moral inculcations and exhortations
by which modern youth are influenced to obedience.
Parents, teachers, and ministers chanted in solemn
and unceasing chorus, "Foolishness is bound up in
the heart of a child," and they believed the only cure
for that foolishness was in stern repression and sharp
correction&mdash;above all in the rod. They found
abundant support for this belief in the Bible, their
constant guide.</p>

<p>John Robinson, the Pilgrim preacher, said in his
essay on <cite>Children and Their Education</cite>:&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[192]</a></span></p>

<blockquote>

<p>"Surely there is in all children (though not alike) a
stubbernes and stoutnes of minde arising from naturall
pride which must in the first place be broken and beaten
down that so the foundation of their education being layd in
humilitie and tractablenes other virtues may in their time
be built thereon. It is commendable in a horse that he be
stout and stomackfull being never left to his own government,
but always to have his rider on his back and his bit
in his mouth, but who would have his child like his horse
in his brutishnes?"</p></blockquote>

<p>The chief field of the "breaking and beating
down" process was in school. English schoolmasters
were proverbial for their severity, and from
earliest days; though monks with their classes are
never depicted with the rod.</p>

<p>We find Agnes Paston, in 1457, writing to London
for word to be delivered to the schoolmaster of
her son Clement, who was then sixteen years old:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"If he hath nought do well, nor wyll nought amend,
pray hym that he wyll trewly belassch hym, tyll he wyll
amend; and so did the last master, and the best that ever
he had, at Cambridge. And say I wyll give hym X marks
for hys labor, for I had lever he were beryed than lost for
defaute."</p></blockquote>

<div class="caption"><p class="center">Katherine Ten Broeck, Three Years Old, 1719</p></div>
</div>

<p>She herself had "borne on hand" on her marriageable
daughter; beating her every week, sometime<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[193]</a></span>
twice a day, "and her head broken in two or
three places." This seems to have been the usual
custom of the British matron in high life. Lady
Jane Grey, when she was fifteen years old, never
came into the presence of her father and mother but
she was "sharply taunted, cruelly threatened, yea,
punished sometimes with pinches, nips, bobs, and
other way." Elizabeth, Lady Falkland, as long as
her mother lived, always spoke to that rigid lady
while kneeling before her, "sometimes for more than
an hour together, though she was but an ill kneeler,
and worse riser." Poor Elizabeth! she was an only
child, "an inheritrice"; but she could truthfully
aver she never was spoiled.</p>

<p>An early allusion to school discipline is in
the <cite>Boy Bishop's Sermon</cite> from the press of Wynkyn
de Worde, who died in 1535. It runs thus:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"There is no fault he doth but he is punished. Sometimes
he wringeth him by the ear, sometimes he giveth him
a strype on the hand with the ferrul, sometimes beateth him
sharply with the rod."</p></blockquote>

<p>Great Cromwell was sent off to school with injunctions
to the master, Dr. Beard, to flog the boy
soundly "for persisting in the wickedness of the
assertion" that he had had a vision and prophecy
of his future greatness. Dr. Johnson told of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[194]</a></span>
unmerciful beating he had by one Master Hunter,
who was "very wrong-headedly severe." He said
the man never distinguished between ignorance and
negligence, and beat as hard for not knowing a thing
as for neglecting to know it, and as he whipped
would shout, "This I do to save you from the
gallows." Still the Doctor was grateful for the
beatings, as he felt to them he owed his knowledge
of Latin; and he approved of the rod, saying of
some well-behaved young ladies whose mother had
whipped them oft and heavily, in variation of one
of Shakespeare's lines, "<em>Rod</em>, I will honor thee for
this thy duty." His creed of correction was this:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"I would rather have the rod to be the general terror
to all, to make them learn, than to tell a child, if you do
this, or thus, you will be more esteemed than your brothers
and sisters. The rod produces an effect which terminates
in itself. A child is afraid of being whipped, and gets his
task, and there's an end on't. Whereas, by exciting emulation
and comparisons of superiority, you lay the foundation
of lasting mischief; you make brothers and sisters hate
each other."</p></blockquote>

<p>The illustrations of old Dutch books that show
school furniture, have the odd ferules of monkish
days, the flat ladle-shaped pieces of wood which
were distinctly for striking the palm of the scholar's<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[195]</a></span>
hand. The derivation of the word "ferule" is interesting.
It is from <em>ferula</em>, fennel. The tough stalks
of the giant fennel of Southern Europe were used
by the Roman schoolmasters as an instrument of
castigation.</p>

<p>This is a sight to give us pain,<br />

<p class="center">Illustration from <cite>Plain Things for Little Folks</cite></p></div>
</div>

<p>Old English lesson books of the seventeenth and
eighteenth centuries, many, even, of the early years
of this century, that have any illustrations of classes,
schoolmasters, or school interiors, invariably picture<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[196]</a></span>
the master with a rod or bunch of birch twigs. An
old herbalist says:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"I have not red of any vertue byrche hath in physick,
howbeit it serveth many good uses, and none better than
for the betynge of stubborn boyes, that either lye or will
not learn."</p></blockquote>

<p>Birch rods were tauntingly sold on London streets
with a cry by pedlers of "Buy my fine Jemmies;
Buy my London Tartars." Even that miserable
<cite>Dyves Pragmaticus</cite> enumerated "Fyne Rod for
Children of Wyllow and Burche" among his wares.
A crowning insult was charging the cost of birch
rod on schoolboys' bills; and in some cases making
the boy pay for the birch out of his scant spending
money.</p>

<p>Birch trees were plentiful in America&mdash;and whippings
too. Scholars in New England were not permitted
to forget the methods of discipline of "the
good old days." Massachusetts schools resounded
with strokes of the rod. Varied instruments of
chastisement were known, from</p>

<div class="poem">
<span class="i0">"A besomme of byrche for babes verye fit<br /></span>
<span class="i1">To a long lasting lybbet for lubbers as meet."<br /></span>
</div>

<p>A lybbet was a billet of wood, and the heavy
walnut stick of one Boston master well deserved
the name. A cruel inquisitor invented an instrument<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[197]</a></span>
of torture which he termed a flapper. It was
a heavy piece of leather six inches in diameter, with
a hole in the middle. This was fastened by an edge
to a pliable handle. Every stroke on the bare flesh
raised a blister the size of the hole in the leather.
Equally brutal was the tattling stick, a cat-o'-nine-tails
with heavy leather straps. The whipping with
this tattling stick was ordered to be done upon
"a peaked block"&mdash;whatever that may be. That
fierce Boston disciplinarian and patriot, Master
Lovell, whipped with strong birch rods, and made
one culprit mount the back of another scholar to
receive his lashing. He called these whippings
trouncings, the good old English word of the
Elizabethan dramatists. Another brutal Boston
master struck his scholars on the head with a ferule,
until this was forbidden by the school directors; he
then whipped the soles of the scholars' feet, and
roared out in an ecstasy of cruelty, "Oh! the Caitiffs!
it is good for them."</p>

<p>There was sometimes an aftermath of sorrow,
when our stern old grandfathers whipped their
children at home for being whipped at school, so
told Rev. Eliphalet Nott.</p>

<div class="figcenter bord" style="width: 350px;"><a name="whispering" id="whispering"></a>
<img src="images/i067.jpg" width="350" height="545" alt="whispering" />
<div class="caption"><p class="center">Whispering Sticks</p></div>
</div>

<p>Many ingenious punishments were invented. A
specially insulting one was to send the pupil out to
cut a small branch of a tree. A split was made by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[198]</a></span>
the teacher at the severed end of the branch, and the
culprit's nose was placed in the cleft end. Then
he was forced to
stand, painfully
pinched, an object
of ridicule.
A familiar punishment
of the dame
school, which lingered
till our own
day, was the smart
tapping of the
child's head with
a heavy thimble;
this was known
as "thimell-pie."
Another was to
yoke two delinquents
together in
a yoke made with
two bows like an
ox yoke. Sometimes
times a boy and
girl were yoked together&mdash;a terrible disgrace.
"Whispering sticks" were used to preserve quiet in
the schoolroom. Two are shown here, wooden
gags to be tied in the mouth with strings, somewhat<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[199]</a></span>
as a bit is placed in a horse's mouth. Children
were punished by being seated on a unipod, a
stool with but a single leg, upon which it was most
tiring to try to balance; they were made to stand on
dunce stools and wear dunce caps and heavy leather
spectacles; they were labelled with large placards
marked with degrading or ridiculous names, such as
"Tell-Tale," "Bite-Finger-Baby," "Lying Ananias,"
"Idle-Boy," and "Pert-Miss-Prat-a-Pace."</p>

<p>One of Miss Hetty Higginson's punishments in
her Salem school at the beginning of this century
was to make a child hold a heavy book, such as a
dictionary, by a single leaf. Of course any restless
motion would tear the leaf. Her rewards of merit
should be also told. She would divide a single
strawberry in minute portions among six or more
scholars; and she had a "bussee," or good child,
who was to be kissed.</p>

<p>Many stories have been told of special punishments
invented by special teachers. The schoolmaster
at Flatbush was annoyed by the children in
his school constantly using Dutch words, as he was
employed to teach them English. He gave every
day to the first scholar who used a Dutch word a
little metal token or medal. This scholar could
promptly transfer the token to the next child who
spoke a Dutch word, and so on; thus it went from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[200]</a></span>
hand to hand through the day. But the unlucky
scholar who had the token in his possession at the
close of school, received a sound whipping.</p>

<p>An amusing method of securing good lessons
and good behavior was employed by old Ezekiel
Cheever, and was thus told by one of his pupils,
Rev. John Barnard:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"I was a very naughty boy, much given to play, in so
much that Master Cheever openly declared, 'You, Barnard,
I know you can do well enough if you will, but you are so
full of play you hinder your classmates from getting their
lessons, therefore if any of them cannot perform their duty,
I shall correct you for it.' One day one of my classmates
did not look at his book, and could not say his lesson,
though I called upon him once and again to mind his book.
Whereupon our master beat me.... The boy was
pleased with my being corrected and persisted in his neglect
for which I was still beaten and that for several days. I
thought in justice I ought to correct the boy and compel
him to a better temper; therefore after school was done I
went to him and told him I had been beaten several times
for his neglect and since master would not correct him, I
would, and then drubbed him heartily."</p></blockquote>

<p>The famous Lancasterian system&mdash;that of monitorial
schools&mdash;discountenanced the rod, but the
forms of punishment were not wholly above criticism.
They were the neck-and-hands pillory, familiar up<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[201]</a></span>
to that date in England and America as a public
punishment of criminals; wooden shackles; hanging
in a sack; tying the legs together; and labelling
with the name of the offence against rules.</p>

<div class="figcenter bord" style="width: 450px;"><a name="falsehood" id="falsehood"></a>

<p class="center">Illustration from <cite>Early Seeds to Produce Spring Flowers</cite></p></div>
</div>

<p>I have found nothing to show that Dutch schoolmasters
were as severe as those of the English
colonies. Dr. Curtius, the first master of the Latin
School in New Amsterdam, complained that "his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[202]</a></span>
hands were tied as some of the parents of his
scholars forbade him punishing their children," and
that as a result these unruly young Dutchmen "beat
each other and tore the clothes from each other's
backs." The contract between the Flatbush Church
and schoolmaster, dated 1682, specifies that he shall
"demean himself patient and friendly towards the
children."</p>

<p>The discipline of Master Leslie, a New York
teacher of the next century, is described by Eliza
Morton Quincy in her delightful <cite>Memoirs</cite>. The
date is about 1782:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"His modes of punishment would astonish children of
the present day. One of them was to hold the blocks.
They were of two sizes. The large one was a heavy
block of wood, with a ring in the centre, by which it was
to be held a definite number of minutes, according to the
magnitude of the offence. The smaller block was for the
younger child. Another punishment was by a number of
leathern straps, about an inch wide and a finger long, with
which he used to strap the hands of the larger boys."</p></blockquote>

<p>One German schoolmaster, Samuel Dock, stands
out in relief in this desert of ignorance and cruelty.
With simplicity and earnestness he wrote in 1750
the story of his successful teaching, as in simplicity
and earnestness he had taught in his school at Shippack.
His story is as homely as his life:&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[203]</a></span></p>

<blockquote>

<p class="center">"<span class="smcap">How I Receive the Children in School</span>.</p>

<p>"It is done in the following manner. The child is first
welcomed by the other scholars, who extend their hands to
it. It is then asked by me whether it will learn industriously
and be obedient. If it promises me this, I explain to
it how it must behave; and if it can say its A. B. C.'s in
order, one after the other, and also by way of proof, can
point out with the forefinger all the designated letters, it is
put into the A-b, Abs. When it gets thus far, its father
must give it a penny and its mother must cook for it two
eggs, because of its industry; and a similar reward is due
to it when it goes further into words; and so forth."</p></blockquote>

<p>He made them little presents as prizes; drew
pictures for them; taught them singing and also
musical notation; and he had a plan to have the
children teach each other. He had a careful set
of rules for their behavior, to try to change them
from brutish peasants to intelligent citizens. They
must be clean; and delinquents were not punished
with the rod, but by having the whole school write
and shout out their names with the word "lazy"
attached. Letter-writing was carefully taught, with
exercises in writing to various people, and to each
other. Profanity was punished by wearing a yoke,
and being told the awful purport of the oaths. He
taught spelling and reading with much Bible instruction;
but he did not teach the Catechism, since<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[204]</a></span>
he had scholars of many sects and denominations;
however, he made them all learn and understand
what he called the "honey-flowers of the New
Testament."</p>

<p>In order to appreciate his gentleness and intelligence,
one should know of the drunken, dirty,
careless, and cruel teachers in other Pennsylvania
schools. One whipped daily and hourly with a
hickory club with leather thongs attached at one
end; this he called the "taws." Another had a
row of rods of different sizes which, with ugly
humor, he termed his "mint sticks." Another,
nicknamed Tiptoe Bobby, always carried a raccoon's
tail slightly weighted at the butt-end; this he would
throw with sudden accuracy at any offender, who
meekly returned it to his instructor and received a
fierce whipping with a butt-end of rawhide with
strips of leather at the smaller end. One Quaker
teacher in Philadelphia, John Todd, had such a
passion for incessant whipping that, after reading
accounts of his ferocious discipline, his manner and
his words, the only explanation of his violence and
cruelty is that of insanity.</p>

<div class="caption"><p class="center">Cathalina Post, Fourteen Years Old, 1750</p></div>
</div>

<p>There is no doubt that the practice of whipping
servants was common here, not only children who
were bound out, and apprentices and young redemptioners,
but grown servants as well. Occasionally<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[205]</a></span>
the cruel master was fined or punished for a brutal
over-exercise of his right of punishment. At least
one little child died from the hand of his murderous
master. In Boston and other towns commissioners
were elected who had power to sentence to be
whipped, exceeding ten stripes, children and servants
who behaved "disobediently and disorderly
toward their parents, masters, and governours, to
the disturbance of families and discouragement of
such parents and governours." In Hartford, Connecticut,
a topping young maid felt the force of a
similar law:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"Susan Coles for her rebellious cariedge towards her
mistris is to be sent to the house of correction, and be kept
to hard labour and coarse dyet, to be brought forth the next
Lecture Day to be publicquely corrected and so to be corrected
Weekly until Order be given to the Contrary."</p></blockquote>

<p>Scores of similar records might be given. Judge
Sewall, in his diary, never refers to punishing his
servants, nor to any need of punishing them. There
is some evidence of their faithfulness and of his
satisfaction in it, especially in the references to his
negro man servant, Boston, who, after a life of
faithful service, was buried like a gentleman, with
a ceremonious funeral, a notice of his death in
the <cite>News Letter</cite>, a well-warmed parlor, chairs set<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[206]</a></span>
in orderly rows, cake and wine, and doubtless
gloves.</p>

<p>John Wynter was the head agent of a London
company at a settlement at Richmond's Island, in
Maine. His wife had an idle maid, and some report
of her beating this maid was sent back to England.
Wynter writes:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"You write of some yll reports is given of my Wyfe
for beatinge the maide: yf a faire way will not doe yt, beatinge
must sometimes vppon such idle girrels as she is. Yf
you think yt fitte for my Wyfe to do all the work and the
maide sitt still, and shee must forbear her hands to strike
then the work will lye vndonn.... Her beatinge that
she hath had hath never hurt her body nor limes. She is
so fatt and soggy shee can hardly doe any work. Yf this
maide at her lazy tymes when she hath bin found in her
yll accyons doe not disserve 2 or 3 blowes I pray you who
hath the most reason to complain my Wyfe or maide. My
Wyfe hath an vnthankful office."</p></blockquote>

<div class="caption"><p class="center">Illustration from "Young Wilfrid"</p></div>
</div>

<p>It has surprised me that this complaint&mdash;and
others&mdash;should have been sent home to England,
where (as we have abundant evidence) the whipping
of servants was excessive and constant. Pepys and
other old English authors make frequent note of
it. Pepys whipped his boy till his arm was lame.
The <cite>Diary of a Lady of Quality</cite> gives some glimpses
of this custom. On January 30, 1760, Lady<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[207]</a></span>
Frances Pennoyer writes at her home at Bullingham
Court, Herefordshire, that one of her maids spoke
in the housekeeper's room about a matter that was
not to the credit of the family. My lady knew there
was truth in what the girl said, but it was not her
place to speak of it, and she must be taught to
know and keep her place.</p>

<p>The diarist writes:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"She hath a pretty face, and should not be too ready to
speak ill of those above her in station. I should be very
sorry to turn her adrift upon the world, and she hath but a
poor home. Sent for her to my room, and gave her choice,
either to be well whipped or to leave the house instantly.
She chose wisely I think and with many tears said I might
do what I liked. I bade her attend my chamber at twelve.</p>

<p>"Dearlove, my maid, came to my room as I bade her. I
bade her fetch the rod from what was my mother-in-law's
rod-closet, and kneel and ask pardon, which she did with
tears. I made her prepare, and I whipped her well. The
girl's flesh is plump and firm, and she is a cleanly person,
such a one, not excepting my own daughters who are thin,
and one of them, Charlotte, rather sallow, as I have not
whipped for a long time. She hath never been whipped
before, she says, since she was a child (what can her mother
and the late lady have been about I wonder?), and she cried
out a great deal."</p></blockquote>

<p>Poor little Dearlove, fair and plump, and in bitter<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[208]</a></span>
tears&mdash;you make a more pleasing picture seen
through the haze of a century than fierce my lady
with her rod.</p>

<p>The many hundred pages of Judge Sewall's diary
give abundant testimony of his tender affection for
his children. In this record of his entire married life
he but twice refers to punishing his children; once
his son was whipped for telling a lie, a second time
he notes the punishment thus:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"1692, Nov. 6. Joseph threw a knob of Brass, and
hit his sister Betty upon the forehead so as to make it
bleed; upon which, and for his playing at Prayer-time, and
eating when Return Thanks I whip'd him pretty smartly.
When I first went in, call'd by his Grandmother, he sought
to shadow and hide himself from me behind the head of
the Cradle, which gave me the sorrowful remembrance of
Adam's carriage."</p></blockquote>

<p>It was natural that Judge Sewall, ever finding
symbols of religious signification in natural events,
should see in his son Joseph's demeanor a painful
reminder of original sin; and we can imagine with
what sad sense of duty he whipped him.</p>

<p>It is the standard resort of ignorant writers upon
Puritanism, and especially upon Puritanic severity,
to give the name of Cotton Mather as a prime
expositor of cruel discipline. I have before me a
magazine illustration which represents him, lean,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[209]</a></span>
lank, violent, and mean of aspect, with clipped head,
raising a heavy bunch of rods over a cowering child.
He was in reality exceedingly handsome, very richly
bewigged, with the full, distinctly sensual countenance
of the Cottons, not the severe ascetic features
of the Mathers, and he as strongly opposed
punishment by the rod as most of his friends and
neighbors favored and practised it. His son wrote
of him:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"The slavish way of education carried on with raving
and kicking and scourging, in schools as well as in families,
he looked upon as a dreadful judgment of God on the
world: he thought the practice abominable and expressed
a mortal aversion to it.</p>

<p>"The first chastisement which he would inflict for any
ordinary fault, was to let the child see and hear him in an
astonishment, and hardly able to believe that the child
would do so base a thing. He would never come to give
the child a blow, except in case of obstinacy, or something
very criminal. To be chased for a while out of his presence
he would make to be looked upon as the sorest
punishment in his family."</p></blockquote>

<p>There can be found episodes of colonial history
where the disprejudiced modern mind can perceive
ample need of the sharp whippings so freely bestowed
upon dull or idle scholars and slow servants.
Cotton Mather was too gentle and too forbearing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[210]</a></span>
toward certain children with whom he had close
relations. A "warm birch" applied in the early
stages of that terrible tragedy, the Salem Witchcraft,
to Ann Putnam, the protagonist of that drama,
would doubtless so quickly have ended
it in its incipiency as to obliterate
it entirely from
the pages of
history.</p>

<p>In ancient days in England, manners and courtesy,
manly exercises, music and singing, knowledge
of precedency and rank, heraldry and
ability to carve, were much more important elements
in education than Latin and philosophy. Children
were sent to school, and placed in great men's houses
to learn courtesy and the formalities of high life.</p>

<p>Of all the accomplishments and studies of the
Squire as recounted by Chaucer in the <cite>Canterbury
Tales</cite>, but one would now be taught in English
college&mdash;music. Of all which were taught,
courtesy was deemed the most important.</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">

<span class="i3">and other vayne pleasure;<br /></span>
<span class="i1">For virtuous manners<br /></span>

</div></div>

<p>The importance given to outward forms of courtesy
was a natural result of the domination for centuries
of the laws of chivalry and rules of heraldry.
But they were something more than outward show.
Emerson says, "The forms of politeness universally
express benevolence in a superlative degree."
They certainly developed a regard for others which
is evinced in its highest and best type in the character
of what we term a gentleman and gentlewoman.</p>

<p>It is impossible to overestimate the value these
laws of etiquette, these conventions of customs had
at a time when neighborhood life was the whole outside
world. Without them life would have proved
unendurable. Even savage nations and tribes have
felt in their isolated lives the need of some conventions,
which with them assume the form of
taboos, superstitious observances, and religious restrictions.</p>

<p>The laws of courtesy had much influence upon
the development of the character of the colonial
child. Domestic life lacked many of the comforts
of to-day, but save in formality it did not differ in
essential elements from our own home life. Everything<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[213]</a></span>
in the community was made to tend to the
preservation of relations of civility; this is plainly
shown by the laws. Modern historians have been
wont to wax jocose over the accounts of law-suits
for slander, scandal-monging, name-calling, lying,
etc., which may be found in colonial court records.
Astonishingly petty seem many of the charges; even
the calling of degrading nicknames, making of wry
faces, jeering, and "finger-sticking" were fined and
punished. But all this rigidity tended to a preservation
of peace. The child who saw a man fined
for lying, who beheld another set in the stocks for
calling his neighbor ill names, or repeating scandalous
assertions, grew up with a definite knowledge
of the wickedness and danger of lying, and a
wholesome regard for the proprieties of life. These
sentiments may not have made him a better man,
but they certainly made him a more endurable one.</p>

<p>The child of colonial days had but little connection
with, little knowledge of, the world at large.
He probably never had seen a map of the world,
and if he had, he didn't understand it. Foreign
news there was none, in our present sense. Of special
English events he might occasionally learn, months
after they had happened; but never any details nor
any ordinary happenings. European information
was of the scantiest and rarest kind; knowledge of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[214]</a></span>
the result of a war or a vast disaster, like the Lisbon
earthquake, might come. From the other great
continents came nothing.</p>

<p>Nor was his knowledge of his own land extended.
There was nothing to interest him in the newsletter,
even if he read it. He cared nothing for the
other colonies, he knew little of other towns. If
he lived in a seaport, he doubtless heard from the
sailors on the wharves tales of adventure and romantic
interest, and he heard from his elders details of
trade, both of foreign and native ports.</p>

<p>The boy, therefore, grew up with his life revolving
in a small circle; the girl's was still smaller. It
had its advantages and its serious disadvantages.
It developed an extraordinarily noble and pure type
of neighborliness, but it did not foster a general
broad love of humanity. Perhaps those conditions
developed types which were fitted to receive and
absorb gradually the more extended views of life
which came through the wider extent of vision,
which has been brought to us by newspapers, by
steam, and by electricity. At any rate children
were serenely content, for they were unconscious.</p>

</div>

<p>Among early printed English books are many
containing rules of courtesy and behavior. Many
of these and manuscripts on kindred topics were
carefully reprinted in 1868 by the <em>Early English</em><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[215]</a></span>
<em>Text Society</em> of Great Britain. Among these are:
<cite>The Babees Book</cite>; <cite>The Lytill Children's Lytil Boke</cite>;
<cite>The Boke of Nurture, 1577</cite>; <cite>The Boke of Curtasye,
1460</cite>; <cite>The Schole of Vertue, 1557.</cite> From those days
till the present, similar books have been written and
printed, and form a history of domestic manners.</p>

<p>It certainly conveys an idea of the demeanor of
children of colonial days to read what was enjoined
upon them in a little book of etiquette which was
apparently widely circulated, and doubtless carefully
read. Instructions as to behavior at the table run
thus:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"Never sit down at the table till asked, and after the
blessing. Ask for nothing; tarry till it be offered thee.
Speak not. Bite not thy bread but break it. Take salt
only with a clean knife. Dip not the meat in the same.
Hold not thy knife upright but sloping, and lay it down at
right hand of plate with blade on plate. Look not earnestly
at any other that is eating. When moderately satisfied
leave the table. Sing not, hum not, wriggle not. Spit
no where in the room but in the corner, and&mdash;"</p></blockquote>

<p>But I will pursue the quotation no further, nor
discover other eighteenth-century pronenesses painfully
revealed in lurid light in other detailed
"Don'ts."</p>

<p>It is evident that the ancient child was prone to
eat as did Dr. Samuel Johnson, hotly, avidly, with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[216]</a></span>
strange loud eager champings; he was enjoined to
more moderation:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"Eat not too fast nor with Greedy Behavior. Eat
not vastly but moderately.
Make not a noise with thy
Tongue, Mouth, Lips, or
Breath in Thy Eating and
Drinking. Smell not of
thy Meat; nor put it to
Thy Nose; turn it not the
other side upward on Thy
Plate."</p></blockquote>

<p>In many households
in the new world children
could not be
seated at the table,
even after the blessing
had been asked. They
stood through the entire
meal. Sometimes
they had a standing
place and plate or
trencher; at other
boards they stood behind
the grown folk and took whatever food was
handed to them. This must have been in families
of low social station and meagre house furnishings.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[217]</a></span>
In many homes they sat or stood at a side-table,
and trencher in hand, ran over to the great table for
their supplies. A certain formality existed at the
table of more fashionable folk. Children were given
a few drops of wine in which to drink the health
of their elders. In one family the formula was,
"Health to papa and mamma, health to brothers
and sisters, health to all my friends." In another,
the father's health only was named. Sometimes
the presence of grandparents at the table was the
only occasion when children joined in health-drinking.</p>

<p>The little book teaches good listening:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"When any speak to thee, stand up. Say not I have
heard it before. Never endeavour to help him out if he
tell it not right. Snigger not; never question the Truth
of it."</p></blockquote>

<p>The child is enjoined minutely as to his behavior
at school: to take off his hat at entering, and bow
to the teacher; to rise up and bow at the entrance
of any stranger; to "bawl not in speaking"; to "walk
not cheek by jole," but fall respectfully behind and
always "give the Wall to Superiors."</p>

<p>The young student's passage from his home to
his school should be as decorous as his demeanor at
either terminus:&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[218]</a></span></p>

<blockquote>

<p>"Run not Hastily in the Street, nor go too Slowly.
Wag not to and fro, nor use any Antick Postures either
of thy Head, Hands, Feet or Body. Throw not aught
on the Street, as Dirt or Stones. If thou meetest the
scholars of any other School jeer not nor affront them,
but show them love and respect and quietly let them pass
along."</p></blockquote>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[219]</a></span></p>

<p>Boys took a good deal from their preceptors,
and took it patiently and respectfully; but I can
well imagine the roar of disgust with which even a
much-hampered, eighteenth-century schoolboy read
the instructions to show love and respect to the boys
of a rival school and not to jeer or fire stones at them.</p>

<p>This book of manners was reprinted in Worcester
by Isaiah Thomas in 1787. I have seen an earlier
edition, called <cite>The School of Manners</cite>, which was
published in London in 1701. The title-page and
a page of the precepts are here reproduced. The
directions in these books of etiquette are plainly
copied from a famous book entitled <cite>Youths' Behaviour,
or Decency in Conversation Amongst Men</cite>, a
book unsurpassed in the seventeenth century as an
epitome of contemporary manners, and held in such
esteem that it ran through eleven editions in less
than forty years after its first appearance. Not the
least remarkable thing about this volume was the
fact that the first edition in English was by an
"ingeniose Spark" not then eight years of age, one
Francis Hawkins, who rendered it from "the French
of grave persons." The bookseller begs the reader
to "connive at the stile," on the plea that it was
"wrought by an uncouth and rough file of one in
green years." Green years! we cannot fancy sober
young Francis as ever green or as anything but a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[220]</a></span>
sere and prematurely withered leaf. We can see him
in sad colored attire, carefully made quill pen in
hand, seated at desk and standish, his poor little
shrunken legs hanging pitifully down, inditing on
foolscap with precision and elegance his pompous
precepts. After all he only translated these maxims;
hence, perhaps, was the reason that he managed to
live to grow up. For translating did not tax his
"intellectuals" as would have composition.</p>

<p>The <cite>Youths' Behaviour</cite> contained many rules and
instructions worded from still older books on courtesy,
such as <cite>The Babees Book</cite>, and <cite>The Boke of Nurture</cite>,
and traces of those hackneyed rules lingered
even in the etiquette books of Isaiah Thomas, long
after the house-furnishings and household conditions
indicated by them and sometimes necessitated
by them had become as obsolete as the formal duties
of the squire's sons, "the younkers of account, youths
of good houses, and young gentlemen henxmen," for
whom they had originally been written. Let us
believe that the habits pointed out by such rules
were obsolete also. I cannot think, for instance,
that the boy born after our Revolutionary war was
in the habit of casting poultry and meat bones under
dining tables, even though he is so seriously enjoined
not to do so. This rule is a survivor from
the earthen floors and dirty ways of old England.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[221]</a></span></p>

<p>A famous book of rules of etiquette, entitled <cite>The
Mirror of Compliments</cite>, was printed in 1635 in England,
and as late as 1795 many pages of it were
reprinted in America by Thomas under the title
<cite>A New Academy of Compliments</cite>. The teachings in
this book were fearfully and wonderfully polite.
This is the sort of thing enjoined upon children
and grown folk as correct phrases to be exchanged
on the subject of breaking bread together:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"Sir, you shall oblige me very much if you will do me
the honour to take my poor dinner with me.</p>

<p>"Sir, you are too courteous and persuasive to be refused
and therefore I shall trouble you.</p>

<p>"Sir, pray excuse your bad entertainment at the present
dinner and another time we will endeavour to make you
amends.</p>

<p>"Truly, Sir, it has been very good, without any defect,
and needs no excuse."</p></blockquote>

<p>The child who sought to be mannerly certainly
must have felt rather discouraged at the prospect
laid before him. These superfluities of politeness
were equalled by the absurdities of restraint. It
would certainly have been a study of facial expression
to see the average schoolboy when he read
this dictum, "It is a wilde and rude thing to lean
upon ones elbow."</p>

<p>In Brinsley's <cite>Grammar Schoole</cite>, written in 1612,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[222]</a></span>
he enumerates the "bookes to bee first learned of
children." First were "abcies" and primers, then
the Psalms in metre, then the Testament.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"Then if any other require any little booke meet to
enter Children, the <cite>Schoole of Virtue</cite> is one of the Principall,
and easiest for the first enterers being full of precepts of
ciuilitie.... And after the <cite>Schoole of Good Manners</cite>,
leading the child as by the hand, in the way of all good
manners."</p></blockquote>

<p>The constant reading of these books, and the
persistent reprinting of their formal rules of behavior,
may have tended to conserve the old-fashioned deportment
of children which has been so lamented by
aged grumblers and lovers of the good old times.
It was certainly natural that children should be
affected by the regard for etiquette, the distinctions
of social position which they saw heeded
all around them, and in all departments of life.
No man could enlist in the Massachusetts Cavalry
unless he had a certain amount of property.
Even boys in college had their names placed in the
catalogues, not by classes, years, scholarship, or
alphabetical order, but by the dignity and wealth of
their family and social position; and a college boy
at Harvard had to give the baluster side of the
staircase to any one who was his social superior.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">[223]</a></span>
Of course the careful "seating of the meeting" was
simply an evidence of this regard of rank and
station.</p>

</div>

<p>It was a profound distance between Mr. and
Goodman. Mistress and Goody marked a distinction
as positive if not as great as between a
duchess and a milkmaid. Unmarried women and
girls, if deemed worthy any title at all, were not
termed Miss, but were also Mrs. Rev. Mr. Tompson
wrote a funeral tribute to a little girl of six,
entitled, "A Neighbour's Tears dropt on ye Grave
of an amiable Virgin; a pleasant Plant cut down in
the blooming of her Spring, viz: Mrs. Rebecka
Sewall August ye 4th, 1710." Cotton Mather
wrote of "Mrs. Sarah Gerrish, a very beautiful and
ingenious damsel seven years of age." Miss was
not exactly a term of reproach, but it was not one of
respect. It denoted childishness, flippancy, lack of
character, and was not applied in public to children
of dignified families. In <cite>Evelina</cite> the vulgar cousins,
the Branghtons, call the heroine Miss. "Lord!
Miss, never mind that!" "Aunt has told you all
hant she, Miss?"</p>

<p>A certain regard for formality obtained even in
very humble households. The childhood of David
and John Brainerd, born respectively in 1718 and
1720, in East Haddam, Connecticut, who later in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[224]</a></span>
life were missionaries to the New Jersey Indians, has
been written by a kinsman. They were nurtured
under the influences of Connecticut Puritanism, in
a simple New England home. Their biographer
writes of their rearing:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"A boy was early taught a profound respect for his
parents, teachers, and guardians, and implicit prompt obedience.
If he undertook to rebel his will was broken by
persistent and adequate punishment. He was taught that
it was a sin to find fault with his meals, his apparel, his
tasks or his lot in life. Courtesy was enjoined as a duty.
He must be silent among his superiors. If addressed by
older persons he must respond with a bow. He was to
bow as he entered and left the school, and to every man
and woman, old or young, rich or poor, black or white,
whom he met on the road. Special punishment was visited
on him if he failed to show respect for the aged, the poor,
the colored, or to any persons whatever whom God had
visited with infirmities."</p></blockquote>

<p>All children in godly households were taught
personal consideration of the old and afflicted, a
consideration which lasted till our present days of
organized charities. As a lesson of patience and
kindness, read Mrs. Silsbee's account of the blind
piano tuner in Salem. He was employed in many
households and ever treated with marked attention.
His tuning instrument had to be placed for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">[225]</a></span>
him on each piano-screw by some member of the
family. He was paid, given cake and wine, then
humored by being given a tangled skein of silk to
unravel and thus show his dexterity, and finally led
tenderly home.</p>

<p>Sir Francis Doyle says, "It is the intention of
the Almighty that there should exist for a certain
time between childhood and manhood, the natural
production known as a boy." This natural production
existed two centuries ago as well as to-day.
Though children were certainly subdued and silent
in the presence of older folk, still they were boys
and girls, not machine-like models of perfection.
We know of their turbulence in church; and boys
in colonial days robbed orchards, and played ball
in the streets, and tore down gates, and frightened
horses, and threw stones with as much vim and
violence as if they had been born in the nineteenth
century. Mather, in his <cite>Vindication of New England</cite>,
referring to the charge of injuring King's
Chapel, shows us Boston schoolboys in much the
same mischief that schoolboys have been in since:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"All the mischief done is the breaking of a few Quarels
of Glass by idle Boys, who if discover'd had been chastis'd
by their own Parents. They have built their Chapel in a
Publick burying place, next adjoining a great Free School,
where the Boyes (having gotten to play) may, some by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[226]</a></span>
Accident, some in Frolick, and some perhaps in Revenge
for disturbing their Relatives' Graves by the Foundation of
that Building, have broken a few Quarels of the Windows."</p></blockquote>

<p>Children did not always pose either as models of
decorum or propriety in their relations with each
other. In a little book called <cite>The Village School</cite>,
we read of their beating and kicking each other,
and that there was one bleeding nose. Worse
yet, when the girls went forth to gather
"daisies and butter-flowers," the ungallant
boys kicked the girls
"to make them
pipe."</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XII</h2>

<h3>RELIGIOUS THOUGHT AND TRAINING</h3>

<blockquote>

<p><em>Puritanism is not of the Nineteenth Century, but of the Seventeenth,
the grand unintelligibility for us lies there. The Fast Day
Sermons, in spite of printers, are all grown dumb. In long rows
of dumpy little quartos they indeed stand here bodily before us; by
human volition they can be read, but not by any human memory
remembered. The Age of the Puritans is not extinct only and gone
away from us, but it is as if fallen beyond the capabilities of memory
itself; it is grown what we may call incredible. Its earnest Purport
awakens now no resonance in our frivolous hearts, ... the
sound of it has become tedious as a tale of past stupidities.</em></p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&mdash;<cite>Oliver Cromwell's Life and Letters. Thomas Carlyle, 1845.</cite></p></blockquote>


<p>The religious aspect of the life of children,
especially in early colonial days, and most
particularly in New England, bore a far
deeper relation to the round of daily life than can
be accorded to it in these pages. The spirit of the
Lord, perhaps I should say the fear of the Lord,
truly filled their days. Born into a religious atmosphere,
reared in religious ways, surrounded on every
side by religious influences, they could not escape<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">[228]</a></span>
the impress of deep religious feeling; they certainly
had a profound familiarity with the Bible. The
historian Green says that the Englishman of that
day was a man of one book, and that book the Bible.
It might with equal truth be said that the universal
child's book of that day was the Bible. There were
few American children until after the Revolution
who had ever read from any book save the Bible, a
primer, or catechism, and perhaps a hymn book or
an almanac.</p>

<p>The usual method at that time of reading the
Bible through was in the regular succession of every
chapter from beginning to end, not leaving out even
Leviticus and Numbers. This naturally detracted
from the interest which would have been awakened
by a wise selection of parts suited to the liking of
children; and many portions doubtless frightened
young children, as we have abundant record in the
writings of Sewall and Mather. J. T. Buckingham
stated in his <cite>Memoirs</cite> that he read the Bible through
at least a dozen times before he was sixteen years
old. Some portions, especially the Apocalypse or
Revelation of St. John, filled him with unspeakable
terror, and he called the enforced reading of them "a
piece of gratuitous and unprofitable cruelty." He
was careful, however, to pay due tribute to the influence
of the Bible upon his literary composition and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">[229]</a></span>
phraseology. The constant reading of the beautiful
English wording of the Bible influenced not only
the style of writing of that day, but controlled the
everyday speech of the people, keeping it pure and
simple.</p>

</div>

<p>There was one important reason for the unfailing
desire of English folk for the Bible and the employment
of its words and terms; it was not only the
sole book with which most English readers were
familiar,&mdash;the book which supplied to them sacred
hymns and warlike songs, the great voices of the
prophets, the parables of the Evangelists, stories of
peril and adventure, logic, legends, history, visions,&mdash;but
it was also a new book. The family of the
seventeenth century that read the words of the small
Geneva Bibles in the home circle, or poorer folk
who listened to the outdoor reading thereof, heard
a voice that they had longed for and waited for and
suffered for, and that their fathers had died for, and
a treasure thus acquired is never lightly heeded.
The Pilgrim Fathers left England for Holland
before King James' Bible, our Authorized Version,
had been published. The Puritans of the Boston
and Salem settlements had seen the importation of
Geneva Bibles forbidden in England by Laud in
1633, and the reading prohibited at their meetings.
They revelled in it in their new homes, for custom<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">[230]</a></span>
had not deadened their delight, and they were filled
with it; it satisfied them; they needed no other
literature.</p>

<p>Though Puritanism in its anxious and restricted
religionism denied freedom to childhood, yet the
spirit of Puritanism was deeply observant and conservative
of family relations. The meagre records
of domestic life in Puritan households are full of a
pure affection, if not of grace or good cheer. The
welfare, if not the pleasure of their children, lay
close to the heart of the Pilgrims. Their love was
seldom expressed, but their rigid sense of duty extended
to duty to be fulfilled as well as exacted.</p>

<p>Governor Bradford wrote in his now world-famous
<cite>Log-book</cite>, in his lucid and beautiful English, an
account of the motives of the emigration from Holland,
and in a few sentences therein he gives one of
the most profound reasons of all, their intense yearning
for the true welfare of their children:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"As necessitie was a taskmaster over them, so they
were forced to be such, not only to their servants but in a
sorte, to their dearest children; the which as it did not
a little wound ye tender harts of many a loving father and
mother, so it produced likewise sundrie sad and sorrowful
effects. For many of theier children, that were of best
dispositions and gracious inclinations, having lernde to bear
the yoake in their youth and willing to beare parte of their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">[231]</a></span>
parents burden, were often times so oppressed with their
hevie labours, that though their minds were free and willing
yet their bodies bowed under ye weight of ye same,
and became decrepid in their early youth, the vigor of
nature being consumed in ye very budd as it were. But
that which was more lamentable and of all sorrows most
heavie to be borne was that many of their children, were
drawne away by evill examples into extravagant and dangerous
coarses, getting ye raines off their necks, and departing
from their parents."</p></blockquote>

<p>This country was settled at a time when all English
people were religious. The Puritan child was
full of religious thoughts and exercises, so also was
the child of Roman Catholic parents, or one reared
in the Established Church. The diarist Evelyn
was a stanch Church of England man, no lover of
Puritan ways, but he could write thus of his little
child:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"As to his piety, astonishing were his applications of
Scripture upon occasion and his sense of God. He had
learned all his Catechism early, and understood all the
historical part of the Bible and New Testament to a
wonder, how Christ came to redeem mankind, and how
comprehending those messages himself, his godfathers were
discharged of his promises.</p>

<p>"He would of himself select the most pathetic psalms
and chapters out of Job, to read to his maid during his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">[232]</a></span>
sickness, telling her, when she pitied him, that all God's
children must suffer affliction. He declaimed against the
vanities of the world before he had seen any. Often he
would desire those who came to see him to pray by him,
and a year before he fell sick to kneel and pray with him
alone in some corner."</p></blockquote>

<p>It was not of a Puritan dame that this was
written:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"Her Maids came into her Chamber early every morning,
and ordinarily shee passed about an howr with them; In
praying, and catechizing, and instructing them: To these
secret and private Praiers, the publick Morning and Evening
praiers of the Church, before dinner and supper, and
another form, together with reading Scriptures, and singing
Psalms, before bed-time, were daily and constantly added."</p></blockquote>

<p>This zealous Christian was Letice, Lady Falkland,
a devoted Church of England woman; so
strict was she that if she missed any from the religious
services, she "presently sent for them and
consecrated another howr of praier there purposely
for them." A strenuous insistence showed itself in
all sects in the new world. The "Articles Lawes
and Orders Divine Politique and Martiall for the
colony of Virginea" were unrivalled in their mingling
of barbarity and Christianity by any other code
of laws issued in America. No Puritan dared go
farther than did the good Episcopalian Sir Thomas<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">[233]</a></span>
Dale. For irreverence to "any Preacher or Minister
of Gods Holy Word" the offender was to be
whipped three times and thrice to ask public forgiveness.
Any one who persistently refused to be
instructed and catechized could be whipped every
day. Rigidly were all forced to attend the Sunday
exercises.</p>

<p>There is one name which must appear constantly
on the pages of any history of New England of the
half century from 1680 to 1728,&mdash;that of Cotton
Mather. This reference is due him not only
because he was prominent in the history of those
years, but because he is the preserver of that
history for us. From his multitudinous pages&mdash;full
though they be of extraordinary religious sentiments,
strained metaphors, and unmistakable slang&mdash;we
also gain much to show us the life of his day.
The man himself was not only a Puritan of the
Puritans, but the personification of a passionate desire
to do good. This constant thought for others
and wish to benefit them frequently led him to perform
deeds which were certainly officious, ill-timed,
and unwelcome, though inspired by noble motives.</p>

<p>His son Samuel wrote a life of him, which has justly
been characterized by Professor Barrett Wendell as
the most colorless book in the English language;
but even from those bleached and dried pages we<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">[234]</a></span>
learn of Cotton Mather's love of his children, and
his earnest desire for their education and salvation.
His son's words may be given as evidently
truthful:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"He began betimes to entertain them with delightful
stories, especially Scriptural ones; and he would ever conclude
with some lesson of piety bidding them to learn that
lesson from the story. Thus every day at the table he
used himself to tell some entertaining tale before he rose;
and endeavor to make it useful to the olive plants about the
table. When his children accidentally at any time came in
his way, it was his custom to let fall some sentence or
other that might be monitory or profitable to them.</p>

<p>"He betimes tried to engage his children in exercises of
piety, and especially secret prayer.... He would often
call upon them, 'Child, don't you forget every day to go
alone and pray as I have directed you.' He betimes
endeavoured to form in his children a temper of kindness.
He would put them upon doing services and kindnesses for
one another and other children. He would applaud them
when he saw them delight in it. He would upbraid all
aversion to it. He would caution them exquisitely against
all revenges of injuries and would instruct them to return
good offices for evil ones.... He would let them discover
he was not satisfied, except when they had a sweetness
of temper shining in them."</p></blockquote>

<p>His thought for the young did not cease with
those of his own family; he never failed to instil<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">[235]</a></span>
good lessons everywhere; and a special habit of his
on visiting any town was to beg a holiday for the
school children, asking them to perform some religious
task in return.</p>

<div class="caption"><p class="center">Charlotte and Elizabeth Hesselius</p></div>
</div>

<p>Another Puritan preacher, Rev. Ezekiel Rogers,
was so laden with the fruit of the tree of knowledge
that "he stoopt for the very children to pick off the
apple ready to drop into their mouths." When
they came to his study, he would examine them,
"How they walked with God? How they spent
their time, what good books they read? Whether
they prayed without ceasing?" He wrote to a
brother minister in 1657:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"Do your children and family grow more godly? I
find greatest trouble and grief about the rising generation.
Young people are little stirred here; but they strengthen
one another in evil by example and by counsel. Much
ado have I with my own family; hard to get a servant
that is glad of catechizing or family duties. I had a rare
blessing of servants in Yorkshire, and those that I brought
over were a blessing, but the young brood doth much afflict
me. Even the children of the godly here, and elsewhere
make a woful proof."</p></blockquote>

<p>These ministers lived at a time when New England
Puritanism in its extreme type was coming to
a close; but parents and households thus reared
clung more rigidly and exactly to it and instilled<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">[236]</a></span>
in it a fervent hope of giving permanency to what
seemed to their sad eyes in danger of being wholly
thrust aside and lost. Such religionists were both
Cotton Mather and Samuel Sewall, "true New-English
Christians" they called and deemed themselves.
They were very gentle with their children;
but a profound anxiety for the welfare of those
young souls made them most cruel in the intensity
of their teaching and warning; especially displeasing
to modern modes of thought are their constant
reminders of death.</p>

<p>When Cotton Mather's little daughter was but
four years old he made this entry in his diary:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"I took my little daughter Katy into my Study and
then I told my child I am to dye Shortly and shee must,
when I am Dead, remember Everything I now said unto
her. I sett before her the sinful Condition of her Nature,
and I charged her to pray in Secret Places every Day.
That God for the sake of Jesus Christ would give her a
New Heart. I gave her to understand that when I am
taken from her she must look to meet with more humbling
Afflictions than she does now she has a Tender Father to
provide for her."</p></blockquote>

<p>The vanity of all such painful instruction, harrowing
to the father and terrifying to the child, is
shown in the sequel. Cotton Mather did not die
till thirty years afterward, and long survived the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">[237]</a></span>
tender little blossom that he loved yet blighted with
the chill and dread of death.</p>

<p>The pages of Judge Sewall's diary sadly prove
his performance of what he believed to be his duty
to his children, just as the entries show the bewilderment
and terror of his children under his teachings.
Elizabeth Sewall was the most timid and fearful of
them all; a frightened child, a retiring girl, a vacillating
sweetheart, an unwilling bride, she became
the mother of eight children; but always suffered
from morbid introspection, and overwhelming fear
of death and the future life, until at the age of thirty-five
her father sadly wrote, "God has delivered her
now from all her fears."</p>

<p>The process which developed this unhappy nature
is plainly shown by many entries in the
diary. This was when she was about five years
old:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"It falls to my daughter Elizabeth's Share to read the
24 of Isaiah which she doth with many Tears not being
very well and the Contents of the Chapter and Sympathy
with her draw Tears from me also."</p></blockquote>

<p>The terrible verses telling of God's judgment on
the land, of fear, of the pit, of the snare, of emptiness
and waste, of destruction and desolation, must
have sunk deep into the heart of the sick child, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">[238]</a></span>
produced the condition shown by this entry when
she was a few years older:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"When I came in, past 7 at night, my wife met me in
the Entry and told me Betty had surprised them. I was
surprised with the Abruptness of the Relation. It seems
Betty Sewall had given some signs of dejection and sorrow;
but a little while after dinner she burst into an amazing
cry which caus'd all the family to cry too. Her Mother
ask'd the Reason, she gave none; at last said she was
afraid she should go to Hell, her Sins were not pardon'd.
She was first wounded by my reading a sermon of Mr.
Norton's; Text, Ye shall seek me and shall not find me.
And these words in the Sermon, Ye shall seek me and die
in your Sins, ran in her Mind and terrified her greatly.
And staying at home, she read out of Mr. Cotton Mather&mdash;Why
hath Satan filled thy Heart? which increas'd her
Fear. Her Mother asked her whether she pray'd. She
answered Yes, but fear'd her prayers were not heard,
because her sins were not pardoned."</p></blockquote>

<p>Poor little wounded Betty! her fear that she
should go to hell because she, like Spira, was not
elected, was answered by her father who, having led
her into this sad state, was but ill-fitted to comfort
her. Both prayed with bitter tears, and he says
mournfully, "I hope God heard us." Hell, Satan,
eternal damnation, everlasting torments, were ever
held up before these Puritan children. We could<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">[239]</a></span>
truthfully paraphrase Wordsworth's beautiful line
"Heaven lies about us in our infancy," and say of
these Boston children, "Hell lay about them in
their infancy." The lists in their books of the
proper names in the Bible had an accompanying list&mdash;that
of names of the devil.</p>

<p>A most painfully explicit account of one of the
ultra-sensitive natures developed by these methods
is given by Cotton Mather in his most offensive
style in a short religious biography of Nathaniel
Mather. The boy died when he was nineteen years
old, but unhappily he kept a diary of his religious
sentiments and fears. He fasted often and prayed
constantly even in his sleep. He wrote out in
detail his covenant with God, and I cannot doubt
that he more than lived up to his promises, as he
did to the minute rules he laid out for his various
religious duties. Still this young Christian was full
of self-loathing, horrible conceptions of God, unbounded
dread of death, and all the horrors of a
morbid soul.</p>

<p>A letter written by an older Mather (about 1638),
when he was twelve years old, shows an ancestral
tendency to religious fears:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"Though I am thus well in body yet I question
whether my soul doth prosper as my body doth, for I perceive
yet to this very day, little <em>growth</em> in grace; and this<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">[240]</a></span>
makes me question whether grace be in my heart or no. I
feel also daily great unwillingness to good duties, and the
great ruling of sin in my heart; and that God is angry
with me and gives me no answers to my prayers; but
many times he even throws them down as dust in my face;
and he does not grant my continued request for the <em>spiritual
blessing of the softening of my hard heart</em>. And in all this I
could yet take some comfort but that it makes me to wonder
what God's <em>secret decree</em> concerning me may be: for I
doubt whether even God is wont to deny grace and mercy
to his chosen (though <em>uncalled</em>) when they seek unto him
by prayer for it; and therefore, seeing he doth thus deny
it to me, I think that the reason of it is most like to be
because I belong not unto <em>the election of grace</em>. I desire that
you would let me have your prayers as I doubt not but I
have them, and rest</p>

<p class="sig">"Your Son, <span class="smcap">Samuel Mather</span>."</p></blockquote>

<p>A strong characteristic of English folk at the
time of the settlement of the American colonies was
superstition. This showed not only in scores of
petty observances but in serious beliefs, such as
those about comets and thunder-storms. It controlled
medical practice, and was displayed in the
religious significance attributed to trifling natural
events. It was evinced in the dependence on
dreams, and the dread of portents. Naturally children
were imbued with the beliefs and fears of their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">[241]</a></span>
parents, and multiplied the importance and the
terror of these notions. It can readily be seen that
religious training and thought, such as was shown in
the families of Samuel Sewall and Cotton Mather,
joined to hereditary traits and race superstitions,
could naturally produce a condition of mind and
judgment which would permit such an episode as
that known as the Salem Witchcraft. Nor is it
anything but natural to find that those two prominent
Bostonians took such important parts in the
progress of that tragedy.</p>

<p>It was my intent to devote a chapter of this book
to the results of the study of the part borne by
children in that sad tale of psychological phenomena
and religious fanaticism. The study proved most
fascinating, and research was faithfully made; but
a stronger desire was that children might find some
pleasure in these pages in reading of the child life
of their forbears. Such a chapter could neither be
profitable to the child nor comprehended by him,
nor would it be to the taste of parents of the present
day. It was a sad tale, but was not peculiar to
Salem nor to New England. The Salem and
Boston settlers came largely from the English
counties of Suffolk and Essex, where witches and
witch-hunters and witch-finders abounded, and Salem
children and parents had seen in their English<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">[242]</a></span>
homes or heard the tales of hundreds of similar
obsessions and possessions.</p>

<p>New England children were instilled with a
familiarity with death in still another way than
through talking and reading of it. Their presence
at funerals was universal. A funeral in those days
had an entirely different status as a ceremony from
to-day. It was a social function as well as a solemn
one; it was a reunion of friends and kinsfolk, a
ceremonial of much expense and pomp, a scene of
much feasting and drinking.</p>

<p>Judge Sewall tells of the attendance of his little
children when five and six years old at funerals.
When Rev. Thomas Shepherd was buried "scholars
went before the Herse" at the funeral. Sargent,
in his <cite>Dealings with the Dead</cite>, tells of country
funerals in the days of his youth:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"When I was a boy and at an academy in the country
everybody went to everybody's funeral in the village. The
population was small, funerals rare; the preceptor's absence
would have excited remark and the boys were dismissed
for the funeral.... A clergyman told me that
when he was settled at Concord, N.H., he officiated at
the funeral of a little boy. The body was borne in a
chaise, and six little nominal pall-bearers, the oldest not
thirteen, walked by the side of the vehicle. Before they
left the house a sort of master of ceremonies took them<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">[243]</a></span>
to the table and mixed a tumbler of gin, sugar and water
for each."</p></blockquote>

<p>A crisis was reached in Boston when funerals had
to be prohibited on Sundays because the vast concourse
of children and servants that followed the
coffin through the streets became a noisy rabble
that profaned the sacred day.</p>

<p>Little girls were pall-bearers also at the funerals
of their childish mates, and young unmarried girls
at those of their companions. Dressed in white
with uncovered heads, or veiled in white, these
little girls made a touching sight.</p>

<p>Religious expression naturally found its highest
point in Puritan communities in the strict and
decorous observance of Sunday. Stern were the
laws in ordering this observance. Fines, imprisonment,
and stripes on the naked back were dealt out
rigorously for Sabbath-breaking. The New Haven
Code of Laws with still greater severity enjoined that
profanation of the Lord's Day, if done "proudly
and with a high hand against the authority of God,"
should be punished with death. This rigid observance
fell with special force and restriction on
children. A loved poet, Oliver Wendell Holmes,
wrote of the day:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem">
<span class="i0">"Hush, 'tis the Sabbath's silence-stricken morn,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">No feet must wander through the tasselled corn,<br /></span><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">[244]</a></span>
<span class="i1">No merry children laugh around the door,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">No idle playthings strew the sanded floor.<br /></span>
<span class="i1">The law of Moses lays its awful ban<br /></span>
<span class="i1">On all that stirs. Here comes the Tithing-man."<br /></span>
</div>

<p>There were many public offices in colonial times
which we do not have to-day, for we do not need
them. One of these is that of tithing-man; he
was a town officer, and had several neighboring
families under his charge, usually ten, as the word
"tithing" would signify. He enforced the learning
of the church catechism in these ten homes, visited
the houses, and heard the children recite their catechism.
These ten families he watched specially on
Sundays to see whether they attended church, and
did not loiter on the way. In some Massachusetts
towns he watched on week days to keep "boys and
all persons from swimming in the water." Ten
families with many boys must have kept him busy
on hot August days. He inspected taverns, reported
disorderly persons, and forbade the sale of
intoxicating liquor to them. He administered the
"oath of fidelity" to new citizens, and warned
undesirable visitors and wanderers to leave the town.
He could arrest persons who ran or rode at too
fast a pace when going to meeting on Sunday, or
who took unnecessary rides on Sunday, or otherwise
broke the Sunday laws.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">[245]</a></span></p>

<p>Within the meeting-house he kept order by beating
out dogs, correcting unruly and noisy boys, and
waking those who slept. He sometimes walked up
and down the church aisles, carrying a stick which
had a knob on one end, and a dangling foxtail on
the other, tapping the boys on the head with the
knob end of the stick, and tickling the face of
sleeping church attendants with the foxtail. Some
churches had tithing-men until this century.</p>

<p>A Puritanical regard of the Sabbath still lingers in
our New England towns. There are many Christian
old gentlemen still living of whom such an
anecdote as this of old Deacon Davis of Westborough
might be told. A grandson walked to
church with him one Sabbath morning and a gray
squirrel ran across the road. The child, delighted,
pointed out the beautiful little creature to his grandfather.
A sharp twist of the ear was the old Puritan's
rejoinder, and the caustic words that "squirrels
were not to be spoken of on the Lord's Day."</p>

<p>With all the religious restriction, and all the
religious instruction, with the everyday repression
of youth and the special Sabbath-day rigidity of
laws, it is somewhat a surprise to the reader of the
original sources of history to find that girls sometimes
laughed, and boys behaved very badly in
meeting. The latter condition would be more surprising<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">[246]</a></span>
to us did we not see so plainly that the
method of "seating the meeting" in colonial days
was not calculated to produce or maintain order.
Boys were not separated from each other into
various pews in the company of their parents as
to-day; they were all huddled together in any undignified
or uncomfortable seats. In Salem, in
1676, it was ordered that all the boys of the town
"sitt upon ye three paire of stairs in ye meeting-house";
and two citizens were deputed to assist the
tithing-man in controlling them and watching them,
and if any proved unruly "to psent their names
as the law directs." Sometimes they were seated
on the pulpit stairs, under the eyes of the entire
audience; more frequently in a "boys pue" in a
high gallery remote from all other Christians, the
"wretched boys" were set off as though they were
religious lepers.</p>

<p>In Dorchester the boys could not keep still in
meeting; the selectmen had to appoint some "meet
person to inspect the boys in the meeting house in
time of divine service." These guardians had to
tarry at noon and "prevent disorder" then. By
1776 the boys were so turbulent, the spirit of
independence was so rife and riotous, that six men
had to be appointed to keep order, and they had
authority to "give proper discipline" if necessary.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">[247]</a></span></p>

<p>It is not necessary to multiply examples of the
badness of the boys, nor of the unsophisticated artlessness
of their parents. Scores of old town and
church records give ample proof of the traits of
both fathers and sons. These accounts are often
as amusing as they are surprising in their hopelessness.
The natural remedy of the isolation of the
inventors of mischief, and separation of conspirators
and quarrellers, did not enter the brains of our
simple old forefathers for over a century. Indeed,
these "Devil's play-houses," as Dr. Porter called
them, were not entirely abolished until fifty years
ago. The town of Windsor, Connecticut,
suffered and suffered from
"boys pews" until
the year
1845.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XIII</h2>

<h3>RELIGIOUS BOOKS</h3>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">

</div></div>


<p>It was inevitable, since the colonization of
America was in the day of Puritanism, that
the first modern literature known by American
children should be the distinctive literature of
that sect and period. These were religious emblems,
controversial treatises, records of martyrdoms, catechismic
dialogues, and a few accounts of precociously
pious infants who had died. Thomas White, a Puritan
minister, wrote thus:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"When thou canst read, read no ballads and romances
and foolish books, but the Bible and the Plaine Man's
Pathway to Heaven, a very plaine holy book for you. Get
the Practice of Piety, Mr. Baxter's call to the Unconverted,
Allen's Alarm to the Unconverted, The Book of Martyrs."</p></blockquote>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">[249]</a></span></p>

<p>The two books which he named after the Bible
had the distinction of being the only ones owned by
the wife of John Bunyan. The confiding Puritan
child who read <cite>The Plain Man's Pathway to Heaven</cite>,
under the promise that it was a "plaine and perfite"
book, must have been sorely disappointed.
But if it wasn't plain it was popular. The twelfth
edition is dated 1733. Foxe's <cite>Book of Martyrs</cite> was
found in many colonial homes, and was eagerly read
by many children. Neither this nor any of the
books on the Rev. Mr. White's list were properly
children's books.</p>

<p>A special book for children was written by a
Puritan preacher whose sayings were very dull in
prose, and I am sure must have been more so in
verse. It was called, <em>Old Mr. Dod's Sayings; composed
in Verse, for the better Help of Memory; and
the Delightfulness of Children reading them, and learning
them, whereby they may be the better ingrafted in
their memories and Understanding</em>. Cotton Mather
also wrote <cite>Good Lessons for Children, in Verse</cite>.</p>

<p>Doubtless the most popular and most widely
read of all children's books in New England was
one whose title-page runs thus: <em>A Token for Children,
being an Exact Account of the Conversion, Holy
and Exemplary Lives and Joyful Deaths of Several
Young Children, by James Janeway. To which is</em><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">[250]</a></span>
<em>added A Token for the Children of New England
or Some Examples of Children in whom the Fear of
God was remarkably Budding before they died; in
several Parts of New England. Preserved and
Published for the Encouragement of Piety in other
Children.</em></p>

<p>The first portion of this book was written by an
English minister and was as popular in England
as in America. The entire book with the title as
given went through many editions both in England
and America, even being reprinted in this century.
In spite of its absolute trustfulness and simplicity
of belief, it is a sad commentary on the spiritual
conditions of the times. I will not give any of the
accounts in full, for the expression of religious
thought shown therein is so contrary to the sentiment
of to-day that it would not be pleasing to
modern readers. The New England portion was
written by Cotton Mather, and out-Janeways Janeway.
Young babes chide their parents for too infrequent
praying, and have ecstasies of delight when
they can pray <em>ad infinitum</em>. One child two years
old was able "savingly to understand the mysteries
of Redemption"; another of the same age was "a
dear lover of faithful ministers." One poor little
creature had "such extraordinary meltings that his
eyes were red and sore from weeping on his sins."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">[251]</a></span>
Anne Greenwich, who died when five years old,
"discoursed most astonishingly of great mysteries";
Daniel Bradley, who had an "Impression and inquisitiveness
of the State of Souls after Death,"
when three years old; Elizabeth Butcher, who,
"when two and a half years old, as she lay in the
Cradle would ask her self the Question What is my
corrupt Nature? and would answer herself It is
empty of Grace, bent unto Sin, and only to Sin,
and that Continually," were among the distressing
examples.</p>

</div>

<p>Jonathan Edwards' <cite>Narratives of Conversions</cite> contained
similar records of religious precocity. There
is a curious double light in all these narratives: the
premature sadness of the children, who seem as old
as original sin, is equalled by the absolute childishness
of the reverend gentlemen, Mr. Janeway, Mr.
Mather, Mr. Edwards, who tell the tales. There
were other similar collections of examples,&mdash;one of
children in Siberia, others in Silesia, and another of
<cite>Pious Motions and Devout Exercises of Jewish Children
in Berlin</cite>. Siberia was apparently as remote and
inaccessible to Boston in those days as the moon,
and the incredulous mind cannot help wondering
who sent and how were sent these accounts to those
trusting Boston ministers.</p>

<p>Another child's book, by James Janeway, was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252">[252]</a></span>
<cite>The Looking Glass for Children</cite>. There had been a
previous book with nearly the same title. Janeway's
book was certainly popular, perhaps because
it was in verse, and children's poetry was very scanty
and rare in those days. It was reprinted many
times, and parts appeared in selections and compilations
until this century. A few lines run thus:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem">
<span class="i0">"When by Spectators I behold<br /></span>
<span class="i3">What Beauty doth adorn me<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Or in a glass when I behold<br /></span>
<span class="i3">How sweetly God did form me,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Hath God such comeliness bestowed<br /></span>
<span class="i3">And on me made to dwell<br /></span>
<span class="i1">What pity such a pretty maid<br /></span>
<span class="i3">As I should go to Hell."<br /></span>
</div>

<p>A book of similar title was <cite>Divine Blossoms, a Prospect
or Looking Glass for Youth</cite>.</p>

<p>The lack of poetry may also account in some
degree for the astonishing popularity of a poem
which appeared in 1662, written by a Puritan
preacher named Michael Wigglesworth, and entitled,
<cite>The Day of Doom; or a Poetical description of
the Great and Last Judgement</cite>. This "epic of hell-fire
and damnation" was reprinted again and again, and
was sold in such large numbers that it is safe to
assert that every New England household, whose
members could read, was familiar with it. It was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253">[253]</a></span>
printed as a broadside, and children committed it to
memory; teachers extolled it; ministers quoted it.
Its horrible descriptions of hell and the sufferings
of the damned are weakened to the modern mind
by the thought of the presumptuous complacence
of the author who would dare to give page after
page of what he conceived the great Judge would
say on the Day of Judgment. But of course no
child, certainly no child of Puritan training, would
note either absurdity or impropriety in assigning
such words, and it is sad to think what must have
been the climax of horror with which a sensitive
child read God's answer to the plea for salvation
made by "reprobate infants"; the terrible words
running on through many stanzas, and ending
thus:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Will you demand Grace at my hand,<br /></span>
<span class="i3">and challenge what is mine?<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Will you teach me whom to set free<br /></span>
<span class="i3">and thus my Grace confine?<br /></span>
<span class="i1">You sinners are, and such a share<br /></span>
<span class="i3">as sinners may expect;<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Such you shall have; for I do save<br /></span>
<span class="i3">none but my own Elect.<br /></span>
</div>

<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Yet to compare your sin with their's<br /></span>
<span class="i3">who liv'd a longer time,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">I do confess yours is much less,<br /></span>
<span class="i3">though every sin's a crime.<br /></span><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254">[254]</a></span>
<span class="i1">A Crime it is, therefore in bliss<br /></span>
<span class="i3">you may not hope to dwell;<br /></span>
<span class="i1">But unto you I shall allow<br /></span>
<span class="i3">the easiest room in Hell."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Thomas White wrote a book for children which
certainly comes under the head of religious books,
though its pages held also those frivolous lines "A
was an archer who shot at a frog," etc. This dreary
volume was entitled a <cite>Little Book for Little Children</cite>.
It contained accounts of short-lived and morbid
young Christians, much like those of James Janeway's
book. One child of eight wept bitter and
inconsolable tears for his sins. One wicked deed
was lying. His mother asked him whether he were
cold. He answered "Yes" instead of "Forsooth,"
and afterward doubted whether he really was cold
or not. Another sin was whetting his knife on the
Sabbath day. Poor Nathaniel Mather whittled on
the Lord's day&mdash;and hid behind the door while
thus sinning. A boy's jack-knife was a powerful
force then as now. This book also had accounts
of the Christian martyrs and their tortures. This
was an English book, first reprinted in Boston
in 1702. An edition of <cite>Pilgrim's Progress</cite> was
printed in Boston in 1681, another in 1706, and
an illustrated edition in 1744, but I doubt that
these were the complete book. Many shortened<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_255" id="Page_255">[255]</a></span>
copies and imitations appeared. One was called
<cite>The Christian's Metamorphosis Unfolded</cite>. Another
<cite>The Christian Pilgrim</cite>. Dr. Neale edited it for
children, making, says a modern critic, "a most
impudent book." Bunyan also wrote <cite>Divine Emblems</cite>,
which the young were enjoined to read, and
he also "bowed his pen to children" and wrote
<cite>Country Rhimes for Children</cite>. For many years no
copy of this was known to exist, but one was found
in America in recent years, and is now in the British
Museum. It is an uncouth mixture of religious
phrases and similes and very crude natural
history.</p>

<p><em>Pilgrim's Progress</em> was the first light reading of
Benjamin Franklin. Other books of his boyhood
were Plutarch's <em>Lives</em>, Defoe's <em>Essays upon Projects</em>,
Cotton Mather's <em>Essays to do Good</em>, and Burton's
<cite>Historical Collections</cite>. Another patriot, at a later
day&mdash;Abraham Lincoln&mdash;learning little but the
primer at school, read slowly and absorbed into his
brain, his heart, and his everyday speech the Bible,
<em>Pilgrim's Progress</em>, &AElig;sop's <cite>Fables</cite> and Plutarch's
<cite>Lives</cite>,&mdash;a good education,&mdash;to which a <cite>Life of

<p>Another book for young people&mdash;which might
be termed a story-book, though its lesson was
deemed deeply religious&mdash;was called, <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_256" id="Page_256">[256]</a></span><cite>A Small
Book in Easy Verse Very Suitable for Children, entitled
The Prodigal Daughter or the Disobedient Lady
Reclaimed</cite>. It was a poem of about a hundred
stanzas, relating
the story of
a very wilful
young woman
who, on being
locked up in her
room by her
father to check
her extravagance,
made a
league with the
Devil, attempted
to poison her
father and
mother, dropped
dead apparently
on her wickedness
being discovered,
was
carried to the
grave, but revived
just as the sexton was about to lower her
coffin in the ground. She recovered, repented, related
her experiences with unction, and lived ever<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_257" id="Page_257">[257]</a></span>
after happy. The title-page bears a picture of the
devil as a fine gentleman wearing his tail as a
sword, and having one high-topped cloven-footed
boot. This book enjoyed unbounded popularity
even during the early years of this century.</p>

<p>It was similar in teaching to a chap-book which
was entitled <cite>The Afflicted Parents, or the Undutiful
Child Punished</cite>. In this tale the daughter gave some
very priggish advice to her wicked brother, who
promptly knocks her down and kills her. He is
captured, tried, condemned, sentenced, and at last
executed by two pardoned highwaymen. But upon
being cut down he comes to life, pompously discourses
at much length, and then is executed a second
time, as a warning to all disobedient children.</p>

<p>Death-bed scenes continued to be full of living
interest. <cite>The Good Child's Little Hymnbook</cite> represents
the taste of the times. One poem is on the
death and burial of twins, and thus is doubly interesting.
Another is on "Dying." The child asks
whether he is going to die and "look white and
awful and be put in the pithole with other dead
people." And yet the preface runs:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem">
<span class="i0">"Mamma See what a Pretty Book<br /></span>
<span class="i3">At Day's Pappa has bought,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">That I may at the pictures look<br /></span>
<span class="i3">And by the words be taught."<br /></span>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_258" id="Page_258">[258]</a></span>After a time some attempts were made to render
the Bible in a form specially for children's reading.
There was a rhymed adaptation called the <cite>Bible in
Verse.</cite> This was not the Bible versification of
Samuel Wesley, printed in 1717, of which he says
condescendingly, "Some passages here represented
are so barren of Circumstances that it was not easy
to make them shine in Verse." Older hands had
essayed to rhyme the Bible; one was called <cite>A
Briefe Somme of the Bible</cite>.</p>

<p>These Bible abridgments were literally little
books, usually three or four inches long, covered
with brown or mottled paper. One tiny, well-worn
book of Bible stories was but two inches long and
an inch wide. It had two hundred and fifty pages,
each of about twenty words.</p>

<p>There was also the famous <cite>Thumb Bible</cite> printed
by the Boston book printers, Mein and Fleming.
A copy of this may be seen at the Lenox Library
in New York City. <cite>The Hieroglyphick Bible with
Emblematick Figures</cite> was illustrated with five hundred
tiny pictures set with the print, which helped
to tell the story after the manner of an illustrated
rebus. Bewick made the cuts for the English
edition. Tiny catechisms were widely printed and
sought after, and used as gifts to good and godly
children. There were also dull little books of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_259" id="Page_259">[259]</a></span>
parables, modelled on the parables of the Bible.
Those were profoundly religious, but were so darkly
and figuratively expressed as to be frequently entirely
incomprehensible; and they fully realized the definition<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_260" id="Page_260">[260]</a></span>
of a parable given by a child I know&mdash;"a
heavenly story with no earthly meaning."</p>

<div class="figcenter bord" style="width: 457px;"><a name="Genesis" id="Genesis"></a>
<img src="images/i082.jpg" width="457" height="600" alt="Genesis" />
<div class="caption"><p class="center">Page of Hieroglyphick Bible</p>
</div></div>

<p>An extremely curious and antiquated religious
panada was entitled the <cite>History of the Holy Jesus</cite>.
The seventh edition was printed in New London
in 1754. The illustrations in this stupid little book
were more surprising than the miserable text. No
attempt was made to represent Oriental scenery.
The picture of an earthquake showed a group of
toy houses and a substantial church of the type
of the Old South in perfect condition, tipped over
and leaning solidly on each other. The Prodigal
Son returned to an English manor-house with latticed
windows, and the women wore high commodes
and hoop-skirts. In the cut intended to represent
to the inquiring young Christian in New England
the Adoration of the Magi, the wise men of the East
appear in the guise of prosperous British merchants;
in cocked hats, knee breeches, and full-skirted coats
with great flapped pockets, they look wisely at the
star-spotted heavens, and a mammoth and extremely
conventionalized comet through British telescopes
mounted on tripods. The Slaughter of the Innocents
must have seemed painfully close at hand
when Yankee children looked at the trim military
platoons of English-clad infants, each waving an
English flag; while Herod, in a modern uniform,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_261" id="Page_261">[261]</a></span>
on a horse with modern trappings, charged upon
them. Perhaps some of the fathers and mothers
born in England and in the Church of England
had a still more vivid realization of Herod's crime,
for it was the custom in some English parishes at
one time to whip all the children on Holy Innocent's
Day. As Gregory said:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"It hath been a custom to whip up the children upon
Innocent's Day morning, that the memorie of this murther
might stick the closer; and in a moderate proportion to act
over the crueltie again in kind."</p></blockquote>

<p>The book was in rhyme. Here are a few of the
verses:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem">
<span class="i0">"The Wise Men from the East do come<br /></span>
<span class="i3">Led by a Shining Star.<br /></span>
<span class="i1">And offer to the new born King<br /></span>
<span class="i3">Frankincense, Gold and Myrrh.<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Which Herod hears &amp; wrathful Grows<br /></span>
<span class="i3">And now by Heavn's Decree<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Joseph and Mary and her Son<br /></span>
<span class="i3">Do into &AElig;gypt flee.<br /></span>
<span class="i1">The Bloody Wretch enrag'd to think<br /></span>
<span class="i3">Christ's Death he could not gain,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Commands that Infants all about<br /></span>
<span class="i3">Bethlehem should be slain.<br /></span>
<span class="i1">But O! to hear the awful cries<br /></span>
<span class="i3">Of Mothers in Distress,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">And Rachel mourns for her first-born<br /></span>
<span class="i3">Snatch'd from her tender Breast."<br /></span>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_262" id="Page_262">[262]</a></span></p>
<p><cite>The History of the Holy Jesus</cite> was told by Rev.
Mr. Instructwell to Master Learnwell. The book
contained also the <cite>Child's Body of Divinity</cite>, and
some of Dr. Watts' hymns. These <cite>Divine Songs
for Children</cite> appear in many forms. The <cite>Cradle
Hymn</cite> is the one most frequently seen, and I
recently have heard it extolled as "a perfect lullaby
for a child." A curious study it is, showing
how absolutely traditional religious conception could
usurp the mind and obscure the impulses of the
heart. Its sweet and tender lines, which begin&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem">
<span class="i0">"Hush my dear, lie still and slumber.<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Holy angels guard thy bed,"<br /></span>
</div>

<p>are soon contrasted with the vehement words which
tell of the lot of the infant Jesus; and at the mother's
passionate expressions of "brutal creatures," "cursed
sinners," that "affront their Lord," the child apparently
cries, for the mother sings:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem">
<span class="i0">"Soft, my child, I did not chide thee,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Though my song may sound too hard."<br /></span>
</div>

<p>In the next stanza, however, theological venom
again finds vent to the poor wondering baby:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem">
<span class="i0">"Yet to read the shameful story<br /></span>
<span class="i1">How the Jews abused their King&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i1">How they served the Lord of Glory,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Makes me angry while I sing."<br /></span>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_263" id="Page_263">[263]</a></span></p>
<p>This certainly seems an ill-phrased and exciting
lullaby, but is perhaps what might be
expected as the notion of a soothing
cradle hymn from
a bigoted old
bachelor.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XIV</h2>

<h3>STORY AND PICTURE BOOKS</h3>

<blockquote>

<p><em>If we are to consider that the condition of the human mind at any
particular juncture is worth studying, it is certainly of importance to
know on what food its infancy is fed.</em></p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&mdash;<cite>The Book Hunter. John Hill Burton, 1863.</cite></p></blockquote>


<p>Locke says in his <cite>Thoughts on Education</cite>
that "the only book I know of fit for
children is &AElig;sop's 'Fables' and 'Reynard
the Fox.'" By this he means the only story-books.
A chap-book, a cheap, ill-printed edition
of &AElig;sop's <cite>Fables</cite>, was read in New England, but
I have found nothing to indicate that these fables
were specially printed or bought for children, or
that children were familiar with them.</p>

<p>There seem to have been absolutely no books
for the special delight of young men and maids in
the first years in the new world, no romances or
tales of adventure; nor were there any in England.
One Richard Codrington, a Puritan, and a tiresome
old bore, wrote a book "For the Instructing of the
Younger Sort of Maids and Boarders at Schools."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_265" id="Page_265">[265]</a></span>
It is about as void of instruction as a book well
could be; and this is his pleasant notion of a
"girl's own book":&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"To entertain young Gentlewomen in their hours of
Recreation we shall commend unto them God's Revenge
against Murther and Artemidorous his Interpretation of
Dreams."</p></blockquote>

<p>It isn't hard to guess which one of these two
was "taken out" most frequently from the school
library. Speculation about dreams was one of the
few existing outlets to youthful imagination, and
many happy hours were spent in elaborate interpretations.
Thus tired Nature's sweet restorer,
balmy Sleep, supplied the element of romance
which the dull waking hours denied, and made
life worth living.</p>

<p>Though no great books were written for children
during all these years, three of the great books of
the world, written with deep purpose, for grown
readers, were calmly appropriated by children with
a promptness that would seem to prove the truth
of the assertion that children are the most unerring
critics of a story. These books were <cite>Pilgrim's
Progress</cite>, first published in 1688; <cite>Robinson Crusoe</cite>,
in 1714; and <cite>Gulliver's Travels</cite>, in 1726. The
religious, political, and satirical purposes of these<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_266" id="Page_266">[266]</a></span>
books have been wholly obscured by their warm
adoption as stories. They have been loved by
hundreds of thousands of English-reading children,
and translated into many other languages.
Hundreds of other
books, chiefly for
children, have been
written, that have
been inspired by or

<p>The history of
children's story-books
in both England
and America
begins with the life
of John Newbery,
the English publisher,
who settled
in London in 1744.
His life and his
work have been told at length by Mr. Charles Welsh
in the book entitled <cite>A Book Seller of the Last Century</cite>.
Newbery was the first English bookseller who made
any extended attempt to publish books especially<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_267" id="Page_267">[267]</a></span>
for children's reading. The text of these books was
written by himself, and by various English authors,
among them no less a genius than Oliver Goldsmith.
His books were promptly exported to America,
where they were
doubtless as eagerly
welcomed as in
England. The
meagre advertisements
of colonial
newspapers contain
his lists. During
Newbery's active
career as a publisher&mdash;and
activity
was his distinguishing
characteristic&mdash;he
published
over two hundred
books for children.
One of the earliest
was announced in
1744 as "a pretty little pocket book." It contained
the story of Jack the Giant Killer.</p>

<p>On a time the men of Gotham fain
would have pinned the cuckoo,
that &#383;he might &#383;ing all the year, all in
the mid&#383;t of the town they had a hedge
made in a round compa&#383;s, and got a cuckoo,
and put her into it, and &#383;aid, Sing
here and you &#383;hall lack neither meat nor
drink all the year. The Cuckoo when
&#383;he &#383;ee her&#383;elf encompa&#383;&#383;ed within the
hedge, flew away. A vengeance on
her &#383;aid the Wi&#383;e Men, we made not the
hedge high enough.</p>

<p>An amusing, albeit thrifty, intermezzo of all children's
books was the publisher's persistent advertisement
of his other juvenile literary wares. If a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_268" id="Page_268">[268]</a></span>
generous godfather is introduced, he is at once
importuned to buy another of good Mr. Newbery
the printer's books. When Tommy Truelove is to
have his reward of virtue and industry, he implores
that it may be a little book sold at the Book Shop
over against Aldermary Churchyard, Bow Lane.
If a kind mamma sets out to "learn Jenny June
to read," she does it with one of Marshall's "Universal
Battledores, so beloved of young masters and
misses." The old-time reader was never permitted
to forget for over a page that the good, kind,
thoughtful gentleman who printed this book had
plenty of others to sell.</p>

<p>Newbery was the most ingenious of these advertisers.
This is an example of one of his newspaper
eye-catchers printed in 1755:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"This day was published Nurse Truelove's New Years
Gift or the book of books for children, adorned with cuts,
and designed as a present for every little boy who would
become a great man, and ride upon a fine horse; and to
every little girl who would become a great woman and ride
in a lord-mayor's gilt coach. Printed for the author who has
ordered these books to be given gratis to all boys and girls,
at the Bible and Sun in St. Paul's Churchyard, they paying
for the binding which is only twopence for each book."</p></blockquote>

<p>Other books were sold "with a Ball and Pincushion,
the use of which will infallibly make<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_269" id="Page_269">[269]</a></span>
Tommy a good boy, and Polly a good girl." The
juvenile characters in the books are always turning
aside to read or buy some one of Mr. Newbery's
little books; or pulling one of Mr. Newbery's
"nice gilded library" out of their pockets, or taking
Dr. James' Fever Powder, which was also one of
Mr. Newbery's popular specialities.</p>

<p>The Revolutionary patriot and printer, Isaiah
Thomas, was said to be very "ingenious in spirit."
I do not know the exact significance of this term
unless it means that he was a wide-awake publisher,
which he certainly was. He was a bright, stirring
man of quick wit and active intelligence in all things.
He brought out just after the Revolution many
little books for children. Few of them have any
pretence of originality, even in a single page. Nearly
all are wholesale reprints of various English books
for children, chiefly those of John Newbery.</p>

<p>I don't know what made Thomas so ready to
catch up the reprinting of these children's books in
advance of other American printers. Perhaps his
attention was led to it by the fact that his "Prentice's
Token," or specimen of his work when he
was a printer's 'prentice, was one of those little
books. It was issued in 1761 by A. Barclay in
Cornhill, Boston, and a copy now in the possession
of the American Antiquarian Society at Worcester,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_270" id="Page_270">[270]</a></span>
Massachusetts, is indorsed in Thomas' own handwriting
as being by his 'prentice hand. The book is
entitled, <cite>Tom Thumbs Play Book. To Teach Children
their letters as soon as they can speak</cite>. It contains
the old rhyme, "A, Apple pye, B, bit it, C, cut it,"
etc. Then came the rhymes beginning, "A, was an
Archer and shot at a frog;" also a short catechism.</p>

<p>Isaiah Thomas lived in Worcester, printed these
books there, and founded there the American
Antiquarian Society; in the library of that society
now in that city may be seen copies of nearly all
these children's books which he reprinted; and a
collection of pretty, quaint little volumes they are.</p>

<p>It is the universal decision of the special students
of juvenile literature, that Goldsmith wrote <cite>Goody
Two Shoes</cite>. Washington Irving thought the title-page
plainly "bore the stamp of the sly and playful
humour" of the author of the <cite>Vicar of Wakefield</cite>.
It reads thus:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"The History of Little Goody Two Shoes, otherwise
called Mrs. Margery Two Shoes, with the means by which
she acquired her Learning and Wisdom, and in consequence
thereof, her Estate; set forth at large for the Benefit of
those</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"See the original manuscript in the Vatican at Rome,
and the Cuts by Michael Angelo. Illustrated by the Comments
of our great modern Critics. Price Sixpence."</p></blockquote>

<p>Copies of <cite>Goody Two Shoes</cite> are seldom seen for
sale to-day, and many copies are expurgated. The
following quaint chapter is the one chosen for excision,
because our children must never hear the word
ghost.</p>

<blockquote>

<p class="center">"HOW THE WHOLE PARISH WAS FRIGHTENED</p>

<p>"Who does not know Lady Ducklington, or who does
not know that she was buried at this parish church?</p>

<p>"Well, I never saw so grand a funeral in all my life; but
the money they squandered away would have been better
laid out in little books for children, or in meat, drink, and
clothes for the poor. This is a fine hearse indeed, and the
nodding plumes on the horses look very grand; but what
end does that answer, otherwise than to display the pride
of the living, or the vanity of the dead. Fie upon such
folly, say I, and heaven grant that those who want more
sense may have it.</p>

<p>"But all the country round came to see the burying, and
it was late before the corpse was interred. After which,
in the night, or rather about four o'clock in the morning,
the bells were heard to jingle in the steeple, which frightened
the people prodigiously, who all thought it was Lady
Ducklington's ghost dancing among the bell ropes. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_272" id="Page_272">[272]</a></span>
people flocked to Will Dobbins, the Clerk, and wanted him
to go and see what it was; but William said he was sure
it was a ghost, and that he would not offer to open the
door. At length Mr. Long, the rector, hearing such an
uproar in the village, went to the clerk to know why he did
not go into the church and see who was there. I go, says
William, why the ghost would frighten me out of my wits.
Mrs. Dobbins, too, cried, and laying hold on her husband
said he should not be eat up by the ghost. A ghost, you
blockheads, says Mr. Long in a pet, did either of you ever
see a ghost, or know anybody that did? Yes, says the
clerk, my father did once in the shape of a windmill, and
it walked all round the church in a white sheet, with jack
boots on, and had a gun by its side instead of a sword. A
fine picture of a ghost truly, says Mr. Long, give me the
key of the church, you monkey; for I tell you there is
no such thing now, whatever may have been formerly.
Then taking the key he went to the church, all the
people following him. As soon as he opened the door
what sort of a ghost do you think appeared? Why little
Twoshoes, who being weary, had fallen asleep in one
of the pews during the funeral service and was shut in
all night. She immediately asked Mr. Long's pardon
for the trouble she had given him, told him she had been
locked into the church, and said she should not have
rung the bells, but that she was very cold, and hearing
Farmer Boult's man go whistling by with his horses, she
was in hopes he would have went to the Clerk for the
key to let her out."</p></blockquote>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_273" id="Page_273">[273]</a></span></p>

<p>It would seem that even an advanced pedagogist
and child culturist might forgive this delightful
ghost&mdash;like a windmill with jack-boots and a gun,
just as a modern grammarian must forgive the verb
"would have went" from little Two Shoes, who,
as Mr. Charles Welsh says, "really ought to have
known better."</p>

<p>The first Worcester edition of <cite>Goody Two Shoes</cite>
was printed in 1787, with some alterations suited
to time and place. Margery sings "the Cuzzes
Chorus which may be found in the Pretty Little
Pocket Book of Mr. Thomas," etc., and when she
grows up she is made a teacher in Mrs. Williams'
"College," which is described in Nurse Truelove's
American books.</p>

<p>It will doubtless be a surprise to many that
<cite>Tommy Trip's History of Beasts and Birds</cite>, etc., was
written by Goldsmith. This little book opens with
an account of Tommy and his dog Jowler, who
serves Tommy for a horse.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"When Tommy has a mind to ride, he pulls a little
bridle out of his pocket, whips it upon honest Jowler, and
away he gallops tantwivy. As he rides through the town he
frequently stops at the doors to know how the good children
do within, and if they are good and learn their books, he
then leaves an apple, an orange or a plumb-cake at the
door, and away he gallops again tantwivy tantwivy."</p></blockquote>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_274" id="Page_274">[274]</a></span></p>

<p>As a specimen of Tommy's literary skill he gives
the lines beginning:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem">
<span class="i0">"Three children sliding on the ice<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Upon a summer's day," etc.<br /></span>
</div>

<p>The description of animals are such as would
be expected from the author of <cite>Animated Nature</cite>,
an amusing medley of
truth and tradition.</p>

<p>The name Tommy
Trip seems to have
been deemed a taking
one in juvenile literature,
and is found in
many books for children,
both in the titles
and as the name of
ascribed author. It was
used until this century.
The title-page of <cite>A
New Lottery Book by
Tommy Trip</cite> is here
shown. The manner
of using this little <cite>Lottery Book</cite> is thus explained:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"As soon as the child can speak let him stick a pin
through the page by the side of the letter you wish to teach
him. Turn the page every time and explain the letter by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_275" id="Page_275">[275]</a></span>
which means the child's mind will be so fixed upon the
letter that he will get a perfect idea of it, and will not be
liable to mistake it for any other. Then show him the
picture opposite the letter and make him read the name of."</p></blockquote>

<p>The antique mind seems to have found even in
Biblical days a vast satisfaction in riddles. Quintilian
said the making and study of riddles strengthened
the reflective faculties.</p>

<p>Old-time jest-books called <cite>Guess Books</cite> were
deemed proper reading for children, such as <cite>Joe
Miller's</cite> and <cite>Merry Tales of the Wise Men of
Gotham</cite>; very stale and dull were the jests. The
<cite>Puzzling Cap</cite> was a popular one; also <cite>The Sphinx
or Allegorical Lozenges</cite>. Others were <cite>Guess Again</cite>,
and one entitled <cite>Food for the Mind</cite>, which bore
these lines on the title-page:&mdash;</p>

<p>Nurse Truelove was a popular character in
these books, and a popular story was <em>Nurse True
Love's New Year Gift, designed as a present to
every little Boy who would become a great Man,
and ride upon a fine Horse, and to every little Girl
who would become a fine Woman and ride in a Governour's

book, one of Newbery's, as shown by his advertisement
already quoted. Thomas Americanized
the Lord Mayor's coach into a Governor's coach,
but he carried out to the fullest extent the English
publishers' mode of advertising. The sub-title of
the book was <em>History of Mistress Williams, and her
Plumb Cake; With a Word or Two Concerning Precedency
and Trade</em>.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"Mrs. Williams when I first became acquainted with
her was a Widow Gentlewoman who kept a little College
in a Country Town for the Instruction of Young Gentlemen<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_277" id="Page_277">[277]</a></span>
and Ladies in the Science of A, B, C. The Books she
put into the hands of her Pupils were, 1st, The Christmas
Box. 2nd, The Father's Gift. 3rd, Mr. Perry's Excellent
Spelling Book. 4th, The Brother's Gift. 5th, The Sister's
Gift. 6th, The Infant Tutor. 7th, The Pretty Little
Pocket Book. 8th, The Pretty Plaything. 9th, Tommy
Trip's History of Birds and Beasts. And when their minds
were so enlarged as to be capable of other entertainments
she recommended to Them the Lilliputian Magazine and
other Books that are sold by Mr. Isaiah Thomas at his
Book Store near the Court House in Worcester, &amp;c., &amp;c."</p></blockquote>

<p>It will be noted that the word college is employed
in its old-time meaning of school; but I am
not sure that Thomas used it innocently. For in
the following pages the text compares Mrs. Williams
to "any other old Lady in the European Universities."
<cite>The Christmas Box</cite> referred to has a decided
American flavor. It was printed in 1789 and is
entitled <cite>Nurse True Love's Christmas Box or a Golden
Plaything for Children</cite>. It gives the history of one
Master Friendly, and is specially forced in style.
Here are two sentences:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"He learned so fast, Dear me! it did my heart good to
hear him talk and read. Why! he got all the little books
by rote that are sold by Mr. Thomas in Worcester, when
he was but a very little boy. Then he never missed church.
Ah! he was a charming boy.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_278" id="Page_278">[278]</a></span></p>

<p>"He is chosen Congressman already and yet he is not
puffed up. Well, I saw him seated in a Chair when he
was chosen Congressman, and he looked&mdash;he looked&mdash;I
do not know what he looked like, but everybody was in love
with him."</p></blockquote>

<div class="figcenter bord" style="width: 350px;"><a name="he" id="he"></a>

<div class="caption">

<p class="center"><em>He! He! He!</em></p>

<p class="center">Two Pages of _A New Lottery Book_</p></div>

</div>

<p>This latter sentence is accompanied by a cut of
Congressman Friendly, imbecile in countenance,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_279" id="Page_279">[279]</a></span>
seated in a chair fixed on two handles, and borne
aloft by four footmen in full livery. This picture
had evidently seen service as "a chairing" in some
English book. When we think what the Congressmen
of that day were,&mdash;earnest, simple-hearted
patriots, and that Thomas knew them well,&mdash;it
seems strange that he could have given such stuff
to American children. On the inside of the cover
are printed these lines:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem">
<span class="i0">"Come hither, little Lady fair,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">And you shall ride &amp; take the Air.<br /></span>
<span class="i1">But first of all pray let me know<br /></span>
<span class="i1">If you can say your criss-cross row.<br /></span>
<span class="i1">For none should e'er in coaches be,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Unless they know their A, B, C."<br /></span>
</div>

<p>It may interest children to read a short story
from one of these little volumes to see the sort
of thing children had to amuse them a hundred
years ago. This is from a book called <cite>The Father's
Gift, or How to be Wise and Happy</cite>.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"There were two little Boys and Girls, the Children of
a fine Lady and Gentleman who loved them dearly. They
were all so good and loved one another so well that every
Body who saw them talked of them with Admiration far
and near. They would part with any Thing to each other,
loved the Poor, spoke kindly to Servants, did every Thing
they were bid to do, were not proud, knew no Strife, but<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_280" id="Page_280">[280]</a></span>
who should learn their Books best, and be the prettiest
Scholar. The Servants loved them, and would do any
Thing they desired. They were not proud of fine Clothes,
their Heads never ran on their Playthings when they should
mind their Books. They said Grace before they ate, and
Prayer before going to bed and as soon as they rose. They
were always clean and neat, would not tell a Fib for the
World, and were above doing any Thing that required one.
God blessed them more and more, and their Papa, Mama,
Uncles, Aunts and Cousins for their Sakes. They were a
happy Family, no one idle; all prettily employed, the little
Masters at their Books, the little Misses at their Needles.
At their Play hours they were never noisy, mischievous or
quarrelsome. No such word was ever heard from their
Mouths as "Why mayn't I have this or that as well as
Betty or Bobby." Or "Why should Sally have this or
that any more than I;" but it was always "as Mama
pleases, she knows best," with a Bow and a Smile, without
Surliness to be seen on their Brow. They grew up, the
Masters became fine Scholars and fine Gentlemen and were
honoured; the Misses fine Ladies and fine Housewives.
This Gentleman sought to Marry one of the Misses, and
that Gentleman the Other. Happy was he that could be
admitted into their Company. They had nothing to do
but to pick and choose the best Matches in the Country,
while the greatest Ladies for Birth and most remarkable for
Virtue thought themselves honoured by the Addresses of
the two Brothers. They all married and made good Papas
and Mamas, and so the blessing goes round."</p></blockquote>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_281" id="Page_281">[281]</a></span></p>

<p><cite>The Brother's Gift, or the Naughty Girl Reformed</cite>,
of which the third Worcester edition was printed in
1791, bore these lines as a motto:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem">
<span class="i0">"Ye Misses, Shun the Coxcomb of the Mall,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">The Masquerade, the Rout, the Midnight Ball;<br /></span>
<span class="i1">In lieu of these more useful arts pursue,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">And as you're fair, be wise and virtuous too."<br /></span>
</div>

<p>Though useful arts were inculcated by this book,
the reward of virtue to the reformed girl was a fine
new pair of stays, which are duly pictured.</p>

<p>Another of Newbery's beloved books was <cite>The History
of Tommy Careless, or the Misfortunes of a Week</cite>.
On Monday Tommy fell in the water, spoiled his
coat, and was sent to bed. On Tuesday he lost his
kite and ended the day in bed. On Wednesday he
fell from the apple tree, and again was put in bed.
Thursday the maid gave him two old pewter spoons;
he made some dump-moulds, and in casting his
dumps scalded his fingers, and as ever was put in
retirement. On Friday he killed the canary bird&mdash;and
to bed again. On Saturday he managed to
incite Dobbin to kick the house dog and kill him;
then he caught his own fingers in a trap, and ended
the week in bed as he began it.</p>

<p>When we think of the vast number of these books,
it seems strange that so few have survived. The
penny books were too valueless to be saved. Sometimes
we find one among abandoned or discarded
piles or bundles of books. It has been the fate,
however, of most children's books to be destroyed
by children. With coarse, time-browned paper,
poor type, and torn, worn leaves, they are not very
attractive. Open one at random. Ten to one you
have before you the page upon which centres the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_283" id="Page_283">[283]</a></span>
interest of the book, its climax, its adventure, or its
high wit. That page was a favorite. Many times
you will find crude attempts at amateur coloring of
the prints.</p>

<p>In these books is found an entirely different code
from that inculcated by modern books or taught by
earlier books. The first books for children simply
exhorted goodness, giving no reasons, but commanding
obedience and virtue. The books of the Puritan
epoch taught children to be good for fear of hell.
This succeeding school instructed them to be good
because it was profitable. All the advice is frankly
politic; much is of mercenary mould. Children are
instructed to do aright, not because they should,
but because they will benefit thereby&mdash;and profit is
given the most worldly guise, such as riding in a
coach, having a purse full of gold, wearing silks
and satins, becoming Lord Mayor, or most exalted
station of all, "a proud Sheriff." As chief officer
of the Crown, the old-time sheriff of each English
county was superior in rank to every nobleman
in the county. The diarist Evelyn tells that his
father when sheriff had a hundred and fifty servants
in livery, and many gentleman attendants.
Punishment, the abhorrence of parents, and evil
results fall upon children not so fiercely for lying,
stealing, treachery, or cruelty as they do for soiling<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_284" id="Page_284">[284]</a></span>
their clothes, falling into the water, tumbling
off walls, breaking windows or china, and a score
of other actions
which are the result
of carelessness,
clumsiness,
or indifference,
rather than of
viciousness.
These books
would educate
(had they been
forcible enough
to be of profound
influence)
generations of
trucklers, time
servers, and
money lovers.
The natural inclination
and the
diversity of inclination
of children made them rise above these
instructions.</p>

<p>It was the constant effort of the artists, authors,
and teachers of olden times to imbue youth with
the notion that no harm could possibly come to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_285" id="Page_285">[285]</a></span>
good&mdash;unless early death could be counted an evil.
Children were taught that virtue and each good
action was ever, immediately, and conspicuously
rewarded. The pictures repeated and emphasized
the didactic teachings; and morality, industry, and
good intentions were made to triumph over things
animate and inanimate. That the old illustrations
were a delight to children cannot be doubted; they
were so easily comprehended. The bad boys of
the story always bore a miserable countenance and
figure, and the good boys were smugly prosperous.
The prim girls are shown the beloved of all, and
the tomboys equally the misery and embarrassment.
All this is lacking in modern picture books, which
so truly represent real life and things that the
naughty boy is not blazoned at first glance as a
different being from the pious delight.</p>

<p>I am inclined to believe that the old-time grotesqueness
was more amusing and impressive to
children than modern realism; that there was a
stronger association of ideas with the emphasis of
disproportion; the absurdities and anachronisms of
scenery and costume were unnoted by the juvenile
reader because he knew no better.</p>

<p>In the children's books which I have examined,
the colored illustrations are all of dates later than
1800 (when dated at all). Mr. Andrew W. Tuer,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_286" id="Page_286">[286]</a></span>
in the preface to his most interesting collection
entitled <cite>Pages and Pictures from Forgotten Children's
Books</cite>, says that the coloring was done by children
in their teens who worked with great celerity.
Each child had a single pan of water-color, a
brush, a properly colored guide, and a pile of
printed sheets. One child painted in all the red
required by the copy, another the green, another
the blue, and so on till the coloring was finished.</p>

<p>There was one book which children loved, that
every little child loves to-day&mdash;<cite>Mother Goose's
Melodies</cite>. Attempts have been made to show that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_287" id="Page_287">[287]</a></span>
the name and collection were both American; that
the former referred to one Mrs. Goose or Vergoose,
a Boston goodwife. The name Mother Goose is
believed by most folk to be of French, not of English
or American origin. A collection of nursery
rhymes was printed for John Newbery about
1760, under the popular name <cite>Mother Goose's
Melodies</cite>; about 1785 Isaiah Thomas issued at
Worcester, Massachusetts, an edition of <cite>Mother
Goose's Melodies</cite> with the songs from Shakespeare,
and certainly this must have been an oasis in the
desert of dull books for New England children.</p>

<p>There is no pretence in this edition of Thomas'
that the book had any American origin; it is
said to be a collection of rhymes by "old British
nurses"; and such it really was. Halliwell says
many of these nursery rhymes are fragments of
old ballads. Mr. Whitmore deems the great popularity
of "Mother Goose" due to the Boston
editions issued in large numbers from 1824 to
1860.</p>

<p>The preface to the Worcester edition of 1785
<em>circa</em> is said to be written by a very great writer of
very little books. Could this have been Oliver
Goldsmith? Irving, in his <cite>Life of Goldsmith</cite>,
refers to the poet's love of catches and simple
melodies, and tells of his singing "his favorite<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_288" id="Page_288">[288]</a></span>
song about An old woman tossed in a blanket
seventeen times as high as the moon." A Miss
Hawkins boasted late in life that Goldsmith taught
her to play Jack and Jill with bits of paper on his
fingers just as we show the trick to children to-day.
Included in these melodies are the verses "Three
children sliding on the ice," which we know were
written by Goldsmith. Here is an example of one
of the melodies and its note:&mdash;</p>

<p>
According to the notion of humor of the day,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_289" id="Page_289">[289]</a></span>the notion of Goldsmith, or some other book-hack-wag,
these notes were all ascribed as quotations from
some profound author, just as the cuts in <cite>Goody
Two Shoes</cite> were said to be by Michael Angelo, and
the text from the Vatican. Thus after the rhymes,
"See-saw, Margery Daw," etc., is the sober comment,
"It is a mean and Scandalous Practice in
an author to put Notes to a Thing that deserves
no Notice. Grotius." After the "Three Wise
Men of Gotham," which ends with the lines&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem">
<span class="i0">"If the bowl had been stronger<br /></span>
<span class="i1">My tale had been longer,"<br /></span>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_290" id="Page_290">[290]</a></span>is the sententious note "It's long enough. Never
lament the Loss of what is not worth having.
Boyle." Puffendorf, Coke on Littleton, Pliny,
Bentley on the <cite>Sublime and Beautiful</cite>, Mapes'
<cite>Geography of the Mind</cite>, are other authors and books
that are soberly cited.

<p>A very priggish little book was entitled <cite>Cobwebs
to Catch Flies</cite>. The tone of its text may be
shown in the dialogue about "The Toss About."
The brothers who attended a country fair had been
forbidden by their mother to ride in the Merry-go-round.
Dear Ned wished to try the fun. Dear
James said with propriety, "Dear Ned, I am sure
our mamma would object to our riding in this Toss-about."
Ned answered, "Dear James, did you
ever hear her name the Toss-about?" "No, dear
Ned, but I am certain that if she had known of it
she would have given us the same caution as she
did about the Merry-go-round." Ned paused a
moment, then said, "How happy am I to have an
elder brother who is so prudent." Whereupon
James replied, "I am no less happy that you are
so willing to be advised," etc.</p>

A distinctly American book for children was
printed in Philadelphia in 1793, a <cite>History of the
Revolution</cite>. It was in Biblical phraseology. This
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_291" id="Page_291">[291]</a></span>sort of writing had been made popular by Franklin<br />
in his famous <cite>Parable against Persecution</cite> which
he wrote, committed to memory, and pretended to
read as the last chapter in Genesis.</p>

Exceeding plainness and even coarseness of speech
was presented in the pages of these old-time story-books.
It was simply the speech of the times
shown in the plays, tales, and essays of the day, and
reflected to some degree even in the literature for
children. As an example of what was deemed wit
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_292" id="Page_292">[292]</a></span>may be given a portion of the prologue to "Who
Killed Cock Robin." The book is entitled <cite>Death
and Burial of Cock Robin</cite>.</p>

<blockquote><p>
"We were all enjoying ourselves very agreeably after
dinner, when on a sudden, Sir Peter's Lady gave so loud a
sneeze as threw the whole company into disorder. Master
Danvers instead of cracking a nut gave his fingers a tolerable
squeeze in the nut-crackers. Miss Friendly who had
carried with intent to put a fine cherry in her mouth
missed the mark and bit her finger. Sir Peter himself,
who was filling a glass of wine, spilled the bottle on the
table. Miss Comely and Miss Danvers who were talking
with each other with their heads very close to each other
very politely knocked them together to see which was the
hardest. I myself had twelve of my ten toes handsomely
trod on by one of the young ladies jumping off a chair in a
fright. But this is not all, no nor half what I was an eye
witness of; for just at the time her Ladyship sneezed, I
was busy contemplating the beauty and song of Miss Prudence's
Cock Robin that was singing and as noisy as a
grig when my Lady sneezed which so frightened him he
fell to the bottom of the Cage as dead as a Stone."</p></blockquote>

<p>
A widely read little book was somewhat pompously
entitled <cite>The Looking Glass for the Mind</cite>.
It was chiefly translated from that much-admired
work, <cite>L'Ami des Enfans</cite>. Those terse and entertaining
tales of Berquin had perennial youth in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_293" id="Page_293">[293]</a></span>their English form and were reprinted till our own
day. The illustrations of Bewick have a distinct
value as showing the dress of children. A few are
here shown. The first is from <cite>William and Amelia</cite>;
both children are not eight years old. The long
trained gowns, bare necks, elbow sleeves, and tall
feathered hats are precisely the dress of grown
women of that day, as William's coat and knee-breeches
are the garb of a man. The two "ladies"
were "walking arm in arm humming a pretty song
then fashionable in the village collection of Ballads."
When they glanced at the apples in the tree William,
"the politest and prettiest little fellow in the
village," dropped his shepherd's pipe, climbed the
tree, and threw down apples in the ladies' aprons.
As Charlotte got more and bigger apples Amelia
abandoned her "usual pleasing prattle," sulked and
at last ordered William to fall down "on his knees
on this instant" to apologize. As he refused Amelia
pouted at dinner, would not touch her wine nor
say "Your good health, William," and at last was
ordered by her mother from the table. William,
after many attempts, sneaked out with some peaches
for her, and thus an affectionate and generous friendship
was restored.</p>

<div class="caption"><p class="center">"Clarissa, or the Grateful Orphan," from <cite>The Looking Glass for the Mind</cite></p></div>
</div>

<p>
Another illustration is for the tale, <cite>Caroline, or
a Lesson to Cure Vanity</cite>. Caroline's dress is further
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_294" id="Page_294">[294]</a></span>described in the text as of pea-green taffety with
fine pink trimmings, elegantly worked shoes, hair
a clod of powder and pomatum. Her "fine silk
slip was nicely soused in the rain"; her hoop
and flounces and train caught in the furzes, her
gauze hat blew in a pond of filthy water, etc.; all
these made her glad to return to a more modest
dress. The illustration for the <cite>Worthy Tenant</cite>
shows Farmer Harris speaking to polite Sophia,
while "Robert was so shamefully impertinent as
to walk round the farmer, holding his nose, and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_295" id="Page_295">[295]</a></span>asking his brother if he did not perceive something
of the smell of a dung heap. He then lighted
some paper at the fire, and carried it around the
room in order to disperse, as he said, the unpleasant
smell," etc. <cite>Clarissa, or the Grateful Orphan</cite>,
who was so good that the king relinquished
a large fortune to her, complete the quartette of
illustrations.</p>

<p>A group of books was published just after the
end of the colonial period, which had a vast influence
on the children of our young Republic. These
books were English; the most important of them
were: <cite>The History of the Fairchild Family</cite>, 1788
<em>circa</em>, by Mrs. Sherwood; <cite>Sanford and Merton</cite>,
1783, by Thomas Day; <cite>The Parents' Assistant</cite>,
1796, by Maria Edgeworth; <cite>Evenings at Home</cite>,
1792, by Dr. Aikin and Mrs. Barbauld.</p>

<p>The painfully religious tales of James Janeway
were not the only ones to familiarize death to
the reading child. <cite>The Fairchild Family</cite> was once
deemed a most charming, as it was certainly a
most earnest book, and it has ever had popularity,
for within a few years it has been reprinted in a
large edition. I wonder how many death-bed
scenes and references there are in that book! Nor
are ordinary death-beds the saddest or most grewsome
scenes. The little Fairchilds having lost their
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_296" id="Page_296">[296]</a></span>little tempers and pommelled each other somewhat,
their father takes them as a shocking object-lesson
to see the body of a man hung in chains on a
gibbet. The horror of the progress through the
gloomy wood to this revolting sight, the father's
unsparing comments, the hideous account of the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_297" id="Page_297">[297]</a></span><em>thing,</em> rattling, swinging, turning its horrible countenance
while Mr. Fairchild described and explained
and gloated over it, and finally kneeled and prayed,&mdash;all
this through several pages no carefully reared
child to-day would be permitted to read. Mr.
Fairchild's reason for taking them to this gibbeted
corpse should not be omitted from this account; it
was "to show them something which I think they
will remember as long as they live, that they may
love each other with perfect and heavenly love."</p>

<p>A painful and ever present lesson found on every
page is the sinfulness of the world. The children
recite verses and quote Bible texts to prove that
all mankind have bad hearts, and Lucy commits
to memory a prayer, a portion of which runs
thus:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote><p>"My heart is so exceedingly wicked, so vile, so full of
sin, that even when I appear to be tolerably good, even
then I am sinning. When I am praying, or reading the
Bible, or hearing other people read the Bible, even then I
sin. When I speak, I sin; when I am silent, I sin."</p></blockquote>

<p><cite>Sandford and Merton</cite> is most insincerely recommended
by many folk to children to-day. I
cannot believe any one who has recently read the
book would ever expect a modern child to care for
it. It is haloed in the memory of people who read
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_298" id="Page_298">[298]</a></span>it in their youth and fancy they still like it, but
won't take the trouble to read it and see that they
don't.</p>

<p>
Jane and Ann Taylor should be added to this
class of authors. The poem, <cite>My Mother</cite>, by Ann
Taylor, was published in book form, and had many
imitations. <cite>My Father, My Sister, My Brother,
My Grandmother, My Playmate, My Pony, My
Fido</cite>, and lastly, <cite>My Governess</cite>,&mdash;all, says the advertisement,
"in the same stile,"&mdash;a style so easily
imitated as to seem almost like parody:&mdash;
</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Who learnt me how to read and Spell,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">And with my Needle work as well,<br /></span>

</div></div>

<p>We have the contemporary opinion of Charles
Lamb of this new school of juvenile literature. In
1802 he wrote thus to Coleridge:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote><p>"Goody Two Shoes is almost out of print. Mrs. Barbauld's
stuff has banished all the old classics of the nursery,
and the shopman at Newbery's hardly deigned to reach
them off an old exploded corner of a shelf, when Mary
asked for them. Mrs. Barbauld's and Mrs. Trimmer's
nonsense lay in piles about. Knowledge as insignificant and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_299" id="Page_299">[299]</a></span>vapid, as Mrs. Barbauld's books convey, it seems must
come to a child in the shape of knowledge; his empty
noddle must be turned with the conceit of his own powers
when he has learned that a horse is an animal, and Billy is
better than a horse, and such-like, instead of the beautiful
interest in mild tales which made the child a man, while
all the time he suspected himself to be no bigger than a
child.... Hang them!&mdash;I mean the cursed Barbauld
crew, those blights and blasts of all that is human in man
and child."</p></blockquote>

<p>It may be seen by the last-named books on this
list that another series of books for children were
abridgments of <cite>Tom Jones</cite>, <cite>Joseph Andrews</cite>, <cite>Pamela</cite>,
and other great novels of the day. Rabelais said no
abridgment of a book could be a good abridgment;
these are worse than none. The childish reader is
notified that if he likes the little books, his good
friend, Mr. Thomas, has the larger books for sale.</p>

<p>The engraving of the great Mr. Richardson sitting
in his grotto, in 1751, in turban, banyan, and
slippers, reading <cite>Sir Charles Grandison</cite> to a group
of friends, chiefly admiring young ladies in great
hats and padusoy sacques, is typical of his life. He
lived in a flower garden of girls, one intimate circle
around his feet, and swelling circles extending even
to America,&mdash;all facing inward and worshipping him
and his works. They wept and smiled in a vast
chorus at the dull pages of <cite>Pamela</cite>, at the surprising
ones of <cite>Clarissa</cite>, and the thousands of
interesting ones of <cite>Sir Charles Grandison</cite>. These
seven volumes of letters exchanged between sixteen
women, twenty men, all lovers, and fourteen Italians
who are enumerated as of another sex, and are likewise
chiefly lovers, are too prolix to be read to-day,
but were a record of love-making which touched
every girl's heart a century and more ago.</p>

<p>Little Anna Green Winslow speaks occasionally
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_301" id="Page_301">[301]</a></span>in her diary of story-books. She had for a New
Year's gift the "History of Joseph Andrews abbreviated
in guilt and flowered covers." She read the
<cite>Pilgrim's Progress</cite>, the <cite>Mother's Gift</cite>, <cite>Gulliver's
Travels</cite>, <cite>The Puzzling Cap</cite>, <cite>The French Orators</cite>, and
<cite>Gaffer Two Shoes</cite>&mdash;this may have been our own
Goody, not Gaffer.</p>

<p>The "flowery and gilt" binding of these books,
so often spoken of in the notices, is wholly a thing
of the past. It was made in Holland and Germany;
but recent inquiry about it discovered that the stamps
and presses used in its manufacture had all been destroyed.
An enthusiastic lover of these little books
wrote:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem">

<p>They were cheap enough, but a penny apiece,
some of them, others sixpence. It is doubtful
whether they were ever sold in America in vast
numbers. Children lent them to each other. Anna
Green Winslow borrowed them, and letters of her
day show other children doing likewise. It was
a day of book-lending; for circulating libraries
were slow of formation. The minister's library
was often the largest one in each town, and he lent
his precious books to his flock. In the sparse<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_302" id="Page_302">[302]</a></span>
advertisements of colonial newspapers are many advertisements
of book owners who have lent books,
forgotten to whom, and wish them returned. The
only way country children had of reading many
books was by borrowing.</p>

<p>American boys and girls felt till our own day
both bewilderment and impatience at forever reading<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_303" id="Page_303">[303]</a></span>
stories whose local color was wholly strange
to them. Dr. Holmes thus expresses this condition
of things:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"Books where James was called Jem not Jim as we
heard it; where naughty schoolboys got through a gap in
the hedge to steal Farmer Giles's red-streaks, instead of
shinning over the fence to hook old Daddy Jones's baldwins;
where Hodge used to go to the ale-house for his
mug of beer, while we used to see old Joe steering for the
grocery to get his glass of rum; where there were larks
and nightingales instead of yellow-birds and bobolinks;
where the robin was a little domestic bird that fed at table
instead of a great, fidgety, jerky, whooping thrush."</p></blockquote>

<p>The debt of amusement which American children
owed to Newbery was paid in this century by the
supply to English children of a vast number of little
books of profit and pleasure, all written by a single
author, "Peter Parley," or Samuel G. Goodrich.
In the middle of the century this gentleman stated
that he had written one hundred and twenty books
that were professedly juvenile. Of these and his
books for older minds about seven million copies
had been sold, and about three hundred thousand
were still sold annually. They were sent to England
in vast numbers, and were reprinted there
both with and without the author's permission.
And when the original books were not pirated, the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_304" id="Page_304">[304]</a></span>
name Peter Parley was calmly attached to the compositions
of English authors, as a vastly salable
trade-mark.</p>

<p>Scores of American authors, by the middle of this
century, were writing little books for children. These
were a class by themselves&mdash;Sunday-school books.
They do not come within the very elastic time limit
set for this chapter. They are not old enough in
years, though they are rapidly becoming as obsolete
as any children's books of the last century.</p>

<p>Books written avowedly for Sunday-schools
are in decreasing demand. Those with
sectarian teachings, especially,
find fewer and fewer
purchasers.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XV</h2>

<h3>CHILDREN'S DILIGENCE</h3>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0"><em>For Satan finds some mischief still</em><br /></span>
<span class="i6"><em>For idle hands to do.</em><br /></span>
</div>

<div class="stanza">
<span class="i8">&mdash;<cite>Divine Songs for Children. Isaac Watts, 1720.</cite><br /></span>
</div></div>


<p>Colonial children did not spend much
time in play. "The old deluder Sathan"
was not permitted to find many idle hands
ready for his mischievous work. It was ordered by
the magistrates that children tending sheep or cattle
in the field should be "set to some other employment
withal, such as spinning upon the rock, knitting,
weaving tape," etc. These were all simple
industries requiring slight paraphernalia. The rock
was the hand distaff. It was simple of manipulation,
but required a certain knack of dexterity to
produce even well-twisted thread. Good spinners
could spin on the rock as they walked. Tape-weaving
was done on a simple appliance, the heddle-frame
of primitive weavers, known as a tape-loom,
garter-loom, belt-loom, or "gallus-frame." On
these small looms girls wove scores of braids and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_306" id="Page_306">[306]</a></span>
tapes for use as glove-ties, shoe-strings, hair-laces,
stay-laces, garters, hatbands, belts, etc., and boys
wove garters and breeches-suspenders.</p>

<p>There was plenty of work on a farm even for little
children; they sowed various seeds in early spring;
they weeded flax fields, walking barefoot among the
tender plants; they hetchelled flax and combed wool.</p>

<p>All the work on the flax after the breaking was
done in olden times by women and children. It is
said there are in all twenty different occupations in
flax manufacture, of which half can be easily done by
children. Much of the work in domestic wool spinning
and weaving was done by little girls. They
could spin on "the great wheel" when they were
so small that they had to stand on a foot-stool to
reach up. They skeined the yarn on a clock-reel.
They easily filled the "quills" with the woollen
yarn used in weaving bedspreads and set the
quills in the middle of the great pointed wooden
shuttles. They wound the white warp on the
spools, and set the spools on the scarne. They
might, if very deft and attentive, help "set the
piece," that is, wind the warp threads on the great
yarn-beam, pass them through the eyes of the heddles
or harness, and the spans of the reed. Girls
of six could spin flax. Anna Green Winslow, when
twelve years old, speaks often in her diary of spinning;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_307" id="Page_307">[307]</a></span>
and when disabled from sewing by a painful
whitlow on her finger, wrote that "it is a nice opportunity
if I do but improve it, to perfect myself in
learning to spin flax."</p>

<p>In the <cite>Memoirs</cite> of the missionaries, David and
John Brainerd, a boy's busy life on a Connecticut
farm is thus described:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"The boy was taught that laziness was the worst form
of original sin. Hence he must rise early and make himself
useful before he went to school, must be diligent there
in study, and promptly home to do "chores" at evening.
His whole time out of school must be filled up with some<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_308" id="Page_308">[308]</a></span>
service, such as bringing in fuel for the day, cutting potatoes
for the sheep, feeding the swine, watering the horses,
picking the berries, gathering the vegetables, spooling the
yarn. He was expected never to be reluctant and not
often tired."</p></blockquote>

<p>This constant employment of a farm boy's time
lasted till our own day; but now conditions have
changed in Eastern farm life. The work still is
hard and incessant, but not so varied as of yore.
Many crops are obsolete; no flax is raised, and
but little wool, and that sold as soon as sheared.
Little grain is raised and no threshing is done by
the flail. Vast itinerant threshing machines go from
farm to farm. Few farmers make cider, which gave
so much work to the boys in autumn. There is no
potash or soap boiling. One of the most delightful
chronicles of obsolete farm industry is written by
Hon. George Sheldon and entitled <cite>The Passing of
the Stall-Fed Ox and the Farmer's Boy</cite>.</p>

</div>

<p>The sawing and chopping of wood was a never
diminishing incubus; this outdoor work on wood
was continued within doors in the series of articles
fashioned for farm and domestic use by the boy's
jack-knife and the few heavy carpenter's tools at his
command; some gave to the farm boy the rare
pennies of his spending money. The making of
birch splinter brooms was the best paying work.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_309" id="Page_309">[309]</a></span>
For these the boy got six cents apiece. The splitting
of shoe-pegs was another. Setting card-teeth
was for many years the universal income furnisher
for New England children. Gathering nuts was a
scantily paid-for harvest; tying onions a less pleasing
one, and chiefly followed in the Connecticut
Valley. The crop of wild cherries known as chokecherries
was one of the most lucrative of the boy's<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_310" id="Page_310">[310]</a></span>
resources. They were much desired for making
cherry-rum or cherry-bounce, and would fetch readily
a dollar a bushel. A good-sized tree would yield
about six bushels. J. T. Buckingham tells of his
first spending money being ninepence received from
a brush-maker for hog-bristles saved from slaughtered
swine.</p>

<p>The story of various silk fevers which raged in
America cannot be given here, romantic as they are.
From the first venture the care of silkworms was
held to be a specially suitable work for children. It
was said two boys, "if their hands be not sleeping
in their pockets," could care for six ounces of seed
from hatching till within fourteen days of spinning,
when "three or four more helps, women and children
being as proper as men," had to assist in feeding,
cleansing, airing, drying, and perfuming them.</p>

<p>The <cite>Reformed Virginia Silk Worm</cite> asserted:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem">
<span class="i4">"For the Labour of a man and boy<br /></span>
<span class="i0">They gain you Sixty pounds which is no toy."<br /></span>
</div>

<p>Mulberry trees were planted everywhere and kept
low like a hedge, so children could pick the leaves.
All the books of instruction of the day reiterate
that a child ten years of age could easily gather
seventy-five pounds of mulberry leaves a day, and
make great wages. But an old lady, now eighty<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_311" id="Page_311">[311]</a></span>
years old, who made much sewing silk in Connecticut
in her youth, writes thus to me: "Girls picked
most of the leaves. It was very hard work and
very small pay. They had ten cents a bushel for
picking. Some could pick three bushels a day."</p>

<p>The first thought of spring brought to the men
of the New England household a hard work&mdash;maple-sugar
making&mdash;which meant vast labor in
preparation and in execution&mdash;all of which was
cheerfully hailed, for it gave men and boys a chance
to be as Charles Kingsley said, "a savage for a
while." It meant several nights spent in the
sugar-camp in the woods, a-gypsying. Think of
the delight of that scene: the air clear but mild
enough to make the sap run; patches of snow
still shining pure in the moonlight and starlight;
all the mystery of the voices of the night,
when a startled rabbit or squirrel made a crackling
sound in its stealthy retreat; the distant hoot of a
wakeful owl; the snapping of pendent icicles and
crackling of blazing brush, yet over all a great stillness,
"all silence and all glisten." An exaltation
of the spirit and senses came to the country boy
which was transformed at midnight into keen thrills
of imaginative fright at recollection of the stories
told by his elders with rude acting and vivid wording
during the early evening round the fire; of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_312" id="Page_312">[312]</a></span>
hunting and trapping, of Indians and bears, and
those delights of country story-tellers in New England,
catamounts, wolverines, and cats&mdash;this latter
ever meaning in hunter's phrasing wild-cats. Think
of "a wolverine with eyes like blazing coals, and
every hair whistling like a bell," as he sprung with
outspread claws from a high tree on the passing
hunter&mdash;do you think the boy sat by the fire
throughout the night without looking a score of
times for the blazing eyeballs, and listening for the
whistling fur, and hearing steps like that of the lion
in <cite>Pilgrim s Progress</cite>, "a great soft padding paw."</p>

<p>What forest lore the boys learned, too: that more
and sweeter sap came from a maple which stood
alone than from any in a grove; that the shallow
gouge flowed more freely, but the deep gouge was
richest in sweet; and that many other forest trees
besides the maple ran a sweet sap.</p>

<p>I believe that in earliest colonial days boys also
took part in a joyful outing, a public custom known
as perambulating or beating the bounds. The
memory of boundaries and division lines, of commons,
public highways, etc., was kept fresh in the
minds of the inhabitants by an old-time Aryan
custom,&mdash;the walking around them once a year,
noting lines of boundary, and impressing these
on the notice and memory of young people.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_313" id="Page_313">[313]</a></span>
To induce English boys to accompany these perambulations,
it was customary
to distribute some
little gratuity; this was
usually a willow wand,
tied at the end with a
bunch of points, which
were bits of string about
eight inches long, consisting
of strands of cotton
or woollen yarn braided
or twisted together, ended
by a tag of a bit of metal or
wood. These points were
used to tie the hose to the
knees of the breeches; the
waistband of the breeches
to the jacket, etc. Long
after points were abandoned
as a portion of
dress the wands with their
little knot of points were
given. Pepys wrote in
1661 that he heard that
at certain boundaries the
boys were smartly whipped to impress the bounds
upon their memories.</p>

</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_314" id="Page_314">[314]</a></span></p>

<p>"Beating the bounds" was a specially important
duty in the colonies where land surveys were
imperfect, land grants irregular, and the boundaries
of each man's farm or plantation at first very uncertain.
In Virginia this beating the bounds was
called "processioning." Landmarks were renewed
that were becoming obliterated; blazes on a tree
would be somewhat grown over&mdash;they were deeply
recut; piles of great stones containing a certain
number for designation were sometimes scattered&mdash;the
original number would be restored. Special
trees would be found fallen or cut down; new marking
trees would be planted, usually pear trees, as
they were long-lived. Disputed boundaries were
decided upon and announced to all the persons
present, some of whom at the next "processioning"
would be living and be able to testify as to the correct
line. This processioning took place between
Easter and Whitsuntide, that lovely season of the
year in Virginia; and must have proved a pleasant
reunion of neighbors, a May-party. In New England
this was called "perambulating the bounds,"
and the surveyors who took charge were called
"perambulators" or "boundsgoers."</p>

<p>To either man or boy of to-day or any day it
would seem an absurdity to name hunting and fishing
in a chapter dealing with boys' diligence; for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_315" id="Page_315">[315]</a></span>
in the sports of the woods and waters colonial boys
doubtless found one of their greatest amusements.
But these sports were also hard work and were
engaged in for profit as well as for pleasure. The
scattered sheepfolds and grazing pastures at first had
to be zealously guarded from wild animals; wolves
were everywhere the most hated and most destructive
beasts. They were caught in many ways; in
wolf-pits, in log-pens, in log-traps. Heavy mackerel
hooks were tied together, dipped in melted
tallow which hardened in a bunch and concealed the
hooks, and tied to a strong chain. If the wolf
swallowed the hooks without any chain attached, it
would kill him; but he might die in the depths of
the forest and his head could not be brought in to
secure the bounty. In old town lists are the names
of many boys with "wolf-money set to their credit."
A wolf-rout or wolf-drive, which was like the old
English "drift of the forest," was a ring of men and
boys armed with guns surrounding a large tract of
forest. The wary wolves scented their enemies afar
and retreated before them to the centre of a circle,
and many were killed. Squirrels and hares were
hunted in the same way. Once a year in many
places they had shooting matches in which every
living wild creature was prey, and a prize was given
to the one bringing in the most birds' heads and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_316" id="Page_316">[316]</a></span>
animals' tails. This cruel wholesale destruction of
singing birds as well as game birds was carried on
almost till our own day.</p>

<p>Foxes were destructive in the hen yards. On a
bright moonlight night the hunters placed a load of
codfish heads on the bright side of a stone wall.
The fish could be smelt afar, and when the keen
foxes approached they were shot by the hunters,
hiding in the shadow. Bears lingered long even in
the vicinity of cities and were hunted with dogs.
The <cite>History of Roxbury</cite> states that in the year 1725,
in one week in September, twenty bears were killed
within two miles of Boston.</p>

<p>In Virginia deer-hunting was a constant sport.
They were "burnt out," and in imitation of the
Indian way of hunting under the blind of a "stalking
head," the English taught their horses to walk
slowly by the huntsman's side, hiding him as he
approached the deer, who were not afraid of horses.
A diverting sport was what was called "vermin-hunting."
It was done on foot with small dogs, by
moon or starlight. Raccoons, foxes, and opossums
were the chief animals sought. Bounties were paid
for the destruction of squirrels and rattlesnakes. It
is appalling to see the bounty lists of some New
England towns for snake rattles. Yet the loss of
life was small from snake bites. The boys profited<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_317" id="Page_317">[317]</a></span>
by all these bounties, and worked eagerly to secure
them.</p>

<p>Wild turkeys were caught in turkey pens, enclosures
made of poles about twenty feet long, laid one
above another, forming a solid wall ten feet high.
This was covered with a close pole and brush roof.
A ditch was dug beginning about fifteen feet away
from the pen; sloping down and carried under one
side of the pen and opening up into it through a
board in which a hole was cut just large enough for
a turkey to pass through. Corn was strewn the
whole length of the ditch. The turkeys followed
the ditch and the corn up through the hole into
the pen; and held their heads too high ever to find
their way out again. Often fifty captives would be
found in the morning.</p>

<p>Boys learned "to prate" for pigeons, that is, to
imitate their call. This was useful in luring them
within gun-shot. A successful method of pigeon-shooting
was learned from the Indians. A covert
was made of green branches with an opening in the
back by which the hunter could enter. In front of
this covert, at firing distance, a long pole was raised
up on two crotched sticks eight or ten feet from the
ground, set so that a shot from the booth would
rake the entire length of the pole; hence the crotch
nearest the booth was a trifle lower than the other,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_318" id="Page_318">[318]</a></span>
at the same angle that the gun barrel would take.
To lure pigeons from a flock to settle on this pole
live pigeons were used as decoys. They were
temporarily blinded in a cruel manner. A hole was
pierced in the lower eyelid, a thread inserted, and
the eyelid drawn up and tied over the eye. A soft
kid boot or loop was put over one leg and a fine
cord tied to it. The pigeon called the long flyer
had a long cord, and by his fluttering attracted
pigeons from a flock. The short flyer with shorter
cord lured pigeons flying low. The hoverer was
tied close to the end of a small pole set on an upright
post. This pole was worked by a string, and
by moving the pigeon up and down it appeared to be
hovering as if to alight. The hunter, loudly prating,
sat hidden behind his three blind, fluttering, terrified
decoys. Then came a beautiful flash and gleam of
color and life and graceful motion, as with a swish
of reversed wings a row of gentle creatures lighted
on the fatal pole. In a second came the report of
the gun, and the ground was covered with the
fluttering, maimed, and dead bodies. Fifty-two at
one shot, a Lexington man named William Locke
killed. Other methods of pigeon-killing were by
snaring them in "twitch-ups"; also in a pigeon-bed,
baited, over which a net was thrown on the
feeding birds.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_319" id="Page_319">[319]</a></span></p>

<p>By the seashore whole communities turned to the
teeming ocean for the means of life. Every fishing
vessel that left the towns of Cape Ann and Cape
Cod carried, with its crew of grown men, a boy of
ten or twelve to learn "the art and mystery" of
fishing. He had a name&mdash;a "cut-tail." He cut
a wedge-shaped bit from the tail of every fish he
caught, and in the sorting-out and counting-up at
the close of the trip his share of the profits was thus
plainly indicated. Long before these fishing industries
were thoroughly organized the early chroniclers
told of the share of boys in fishing. Even John
Smith stirred up English stay-at-homes, saying:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"Young boyes, girles, salvages or any others, bee they
never such idlers, may turne, carry, and returne fish without
shame, or either greate paine: hee is very idle that is
past twelve years of age and cannot doe so much; and
shee is very old that cannot spin a thread to catch them."</p></blockquote>

<p>It was natural that boys born in seashore towns
should turn to the sea. They found in the incoming
ships their sole connecting link with the outside
world. Romance, sentiment, mystery, deviltry,
haloed the sailor. He was ever welcome to the
public, and ever a source of interest whether in
tarry working garb, or gay shore togs of flapping
trousers, crimson sash, eelskin and cutlasses, or<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_320" id="Page_320">[320]</a></span>
perhaps garbed like Captain Creedon, who appeared
in Boston in the year 1662 dressed, so says the
letter of a Boston minister, "in a strange habitt with
a 4 Cornered Capp instead of a hatt and his
Breeches hung with Ribbons from the Wast downward
a great depth one over the other like the
Shingles of a house." Naturally enough "the boys
made an outcry and wondered."</p>

<p>Can it be wondered that two centuries of New
England boys, stirred in their quiet round of life by
similar gay comets and tales of adventure, have had a
passionate ichor in their veins of longing for "the
magic and the mystery of the sea," that they have
eagerly gone before the mast, and rounded the Horn,
and come home master seamen when in their teens.
I know a New England family of dignity and wealth
in which six successive generations of sons have gone
to sea in their boyhood, some of later years running
away from home to do so. In Portsmouth, New
Hampshire, in 1787,&mdash;so tells a newspaper of that
date,&mdash;were living a man and wife who
had been married about twenty years,
and had eighteen sons, of
whom ten were
then at
sea.</p>

<p>Human nature was the same in the seventeenth
and eighteenth centuries as to-day;
waves of devotion to some special form
of ornamentation either for the household or the
wardrobe swept over families, neighborhoods, communities;
when we reach the days of newspapers
we find in their columns some evidence of the
names and character of these decorations. In 1716
Mr. Brownell, the Boston schoolmaster, advertised
that at his school young women and children
could be taught "all sorts of fine works as Feather-works,
Filigree, and Painting on Glass, Embroidering
a new way, Turkeywork for Handkerchiefs
two new Ways, fine new fashion Purses, flourishing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_322" id="Page_322">[322]</a></span>
ishing and Plain work," The perishable nature
of the material would prevent the preservation of
many specimens of feather-work; but very pretty
flowers for head-dresses and bonnets were made
of minute feathers or portions of feathers pasted on
a firm foundation in many collected shapes. This
work may have been suggested by the beautiful
feather flowers made in many of the South Sea
Islands; perhaps an old sea captain brought some
home to his wife or sweetheart as a gift. The sober
colors of many of our home birds would not make
so brilliant a bouquet as the songless birds of the
tropics, especially the millions of the various parrot
tribes; still an everyday New England rooster has
a wealth of splendid glistening color, while blue
jays, red-headed woodpeckers, yellow birds, and an
occasional oriole or scarlet tanager could furnish
beautiful feathers enough to waken the ire of an
Audubon Society.</p>

<p>Painting on glass was an amusement of more
scope. In England it was all the mode, and some
very quaint specimens survive; simpering beauties,
flowers, and fruit were the favorite subjects. Coats
of arms, too, were painted on glass, and handsome
they were. It is not possible to state exactly the
position which the study of armorial bearings and
significations had for two or three centuries. It<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_323" id="Page_323">[323]</a></span>
seemed to bear relatively the same place that a profound
study of literature has to-day&mdash;the pastime
and delight of cultured people. We have been
amused for a few years past at the domination of
color in literature; every book title had a color
word, as <cite>The Red Robe</cite>, <cite>Under the Red Lamp</cite>, <cite>A
Study in Scarlet</cite>, <cite>The Red Badge of Courage</cite>, etc. This
idiasm&mdash;as Mr. Ingleby would call it&mdash;has extended
to music, and even into scientific suggestion
and medicine; but this attributing unusual qualities
to colors is nothing new. In the Cotton Manuscripts,
a series of essays on music six hundred years
old, the relation between music and color, especially
in coat armor, is given; for instance, "fire-red" was
the most malignant color in arms, and only third in
benignity in music. All gentlefolk were profoundly
wise as to the meaning of colors in coats of arms,
etc., and their influence on the character and life of
the persons bearing the arms.</p>

<p>This interest in the study of heraldry wavered in
intensity but did not die till the days of a new
nation; and we find from the middle of the seventeenth
to the middle of the eighteenth century that
young girls in the families of gentlefolk paid much
attention to the making of coats of arms. Those
painted on glass were the richest in color and the
most satisfactory, but embroidered ones were more<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_324" id="Page_324">[324]</a></span>
common. The choicest materials were used, the
drawing was carefully executed, and the stitches
minute. It is interesting to note that the laws of
the herald were strictly regarded in the setting of the
stitches. In <em>azure</em> the stitches were laid parallel
across the escutcheon; in <em>gules</em>, perpendicular; in
<em>purpure</em>, diagonally from right to left, and so on.</p>

<div class="caption"><p class="center">Jerusha Pitkin's Embroidery and Frame</p></div>
</div>

<p>Here is shown an unfinished coat of arms of the
Pitkin family which belonged to Jerusha Pitkin,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_325" id="Page_325">[325]</a></span>
who was born in 1736. The frame upon which
the work is stretched, the manner in which it is
mounted, the hand-made nails that fasten it, the way
the work is outlined, are all of interest. The needle
still is thrust in the black satin background where
it was left by girlish hands a century and a half ago.
Colored silks, gold bullion and thread to complete
this work have been preserved with it. The embroidery
is on black satin, and is lozenge-shaped,
as was the proper shape of a hatchment or mourning
emblem; and it is possible that this work was
begun as a funeral piece, commemorative of some
Pitkin ancestor.</p>

<p>Such funeral pieces were deemed a very dignified
observance of respect and mark of affection. They
had as successors what were definitely termed
"mourning pieces," bearing stiff presentments of
funeral urns, monuments, drooping willows, and
sometimes a bowed and weeping figure.</p>

<p>After the death of Washington, mourning designs
deploring our national loss and significant of our
affection and respect for that honored name appeared
in vast numbers. Framed prints of these designs
hung on every wall, table china in large numbers and
variety bore these funereal emblems, and laudatory
and sad mottoes. As other Revolutionary heroes
passed away, similar designs appeared in more limited<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_326" id="Page_326">[326]</a></span>
numbers, and the reign of embroidered "mourning
pieces" may be said to begin at this time.
Washington&mdash;so to speak&mdash;set the fashion. Familiarized
with the hideous Apotheosis pitcher, or
the gloomy Washington's Tomb teacups as set on a
festal board, special mourning embroideries did not
seem oversad for decorative purposes, and soon
no properly ambitious household was without one.
They were even embroidered when the family circle
was unbroken, and an empty space was left yawning
like an open grave for some one to die. Religious
designs were also eagerly sought for. The Tree
of Life was a favorite. A conventional tree was
hung at wide intervals with apples, bearing the
names of various virtues and estimable traits of
humanity, such as Honor, Modesty, Silence, Patience,
etc. The sparse harvest of these emblematic
fruits seemed to indicate a cynical belief in scant
nobility of nature; but there was hope of improvement,
for a white-winged angel assiduously watered
the roots of the tree with a realistic watering-pot.
The devil, never absent in that day from art, science,
or literature, also loomed in blackness beneath
the branches, but sadly handicapped from activity
by being forced to carry a colossal pitchfork and
an absolutely unsurmountable tail of gigantic proportions.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_327" id="Page_327">[327]</a></span></p>

<p>These mourning pieces
were but decadent successors
of the significant
heraldic embroideries of
earlier days. We passed
through trying days in
art, architecture, and costume
in the first half of
this century; and it was
not until we revived the
older forms of embroidery,
and the ancient
stitches, that we rallied
from the blight of commonplaceness
and sentimentality
which seemed
to spread over everything.</p>

<div class="caption"><p class="center">Lora Standish's Sampler</p></div>
</div>

<p>The most universal
and best-preserved piece
of embroidery done by our
foremothers was the sampler.
These were known
as sampleths, sam-cloths,
saumplers, and sampleres;
the titles were
all derived by apheresis
from <em>esampler</em>, <em>exampleir</em>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_328" id="Page_328">[328]</a></span></p>

<p>The sampler "contrived a double debt to pay"
of teaching letters and stitches; it was, in fact, a
needlework hornbook, containing the alphabet, a
verse indicative of good morals or industry, or a sentence
from the Bible, the name and date, and some
crude representations of impossible birds, beasts,
flowers, trees, or human beings. Though the sampler's
reign in every American household was in the
eighteenth century and the earlier years of the nineteenth,
it was the direct successor of the glories of
needlework of English women of earlier years, which
was known and admired on the Continent as <i>Opus
Anglicanum</i>. The chief excellency of English needlework
has even been closely associated with a high
state of social morals. In Elizabeth's day Englishwomen
still loved needlecraft. Shakespeare, Sidney,
Milton, Herrick, all refer to women's samplers.
In a collection of old ballads printed in 1725 is
"A Short and Sweet Sonnet made by one of the
Maids of Honour upon the death of Q. Elizabeth,
which she sewed upon a Sampler of Red
Silk":&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem">
<span class="i0">"Gone is <em>Elizabeth</em> whom we have loved so dear,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">She our kind Mistress was full four and Forty Year,<br /></span>
<span class="i1"><em>England</em> she govern'd well not to be blamed.<br /></span>
<span class="i1"><em>Flanders</em> she govern'd well, and <em>Ireland</em> famed.<br /></span>
<span class="i1">France she befriended, Spain she had toiled,<br /></span>
<span class="i1"><em>Papists</em> rejected, and the <em>Pope</em> spoiled.<br /></span><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_329" id="Page_329">[329]</a></span>
<span class="i1">To <em>Princes</em> powerful, to the <em>World</em> vertuous,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">To her <em>Foes</em> merciful, to subjects gracious.<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Her Soul is in Heaven, the World keeps her glory,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Subjects her good deeds, so ends my Story."<br /></span>
</div>

<p>In the licentious days of King James and King
Charles there is little record of women's needlework
in court or country, but the Puritan women,
the virtuous home makers, revived and encouraged
all household arts.</p>

<p>There is no doubt that as a rule the long and
narrow samplers are older than those more nearly
square. These ancient samplers, especially the few
bearing dates of the seventeenth century, are much
finer in design, more closely worked, and better in
execution than those of later date. The linen background
is much more closely covered. They have
more curious and varied stitches. Occasionally they
are of minute size, but four or five inches long, with
exquisitely fine stitches.</p>

<img src="images/i105.jpg" width="188" height="600" alt="Fleetwood" />
<div class="caption"><p class="center">Fleetwood-Quincy Sampler</p></div>
</div>

<p>Two ancient samplers are here depicted. One
shown on page 327 was made by Lora Standish, the
daughter of a Pilgrim Father, and it is now at
Pilgrim Hall, Plymouth. The interesting and
beautiful sampler known as the Fleetwood-Quincy
Sampler has such perfect stitches that both sides are
alike. It bears the names Miles and Abigail Fleetwood,
and the date 1654. It has been in the possession<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_330" id="Page_330">[330]</a></span>
of Mrs. Henry
Quincy and her descendants
since 1750. There
is little doubt that the
Miles Fleetwood of the
sampler was the brother
or nephew of Charles
Fleetwood who married
Anne Ireton, eldest
daughter of great Cromwell.
A splendid piece
of Anne Fleetwood's embroidery
was recently exhibited
in the Kensington
Museum. It was scarcely
a sampler for it bore a
curious design in applique
work of a lozenge formed
by four right-angled triangles,
each of a different
bit of rich brocade of gold
and silver figures on amber
or pink ground; all
worked together with
curious vines and stitches.
Miles Fleetwood clung
to the royal cause, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_331" id="Page_331">[331]</a></span>
thus fell into the obscurity hinted at in the sampler
verses:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem">
<span class="i0">"In prosperity friends will be plenty,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">But in adversity not one in twenty."<br /></span>
</div>

<p>In the older samplers little attention is paid to
the representation of things in their real colors; a
green horse may balance a blue tree. And as flat
tints were used there were few effects of light and
shade, and no perspective. Distance is indicated by
a different color of worsted; thus the green horse
will have his off legs worked in red. This is
precisely the method used in the Bayeux Tapestry
and other antique embroideries.</p>

<p>Sampler verses had their times and seasons, and
ran through families. They were eagerly copied
for young friends, and, in a few cases, were "natural
composures"&mdash;or, as we should say to-day,
"original compositions." Ruth Gray of Salem embroidered
on her sampler a century ago:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem">
<span class="i0">"Next unto God, dear Parents, I address<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Myself to you in humble Thankfulness.<br /></span>
<span class="i1">For all your Care and Charge on me bestow'd,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">The means of learning unto me allowed.<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Go on! I pray, and let me still Pursue<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Such Golden Arts the Vulgar never knew."<br /></span>
</div>

<p>To show the extent to which those lines could be
transmitted let me state that they are found on a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_332" id="Page_332">[332]</a></span>
sampler in Dorchester, Massachusetts, worked in
1802, one in Waltham, Massachusetts, one worked
in 1813 in a seminary in Boston, one in Medford,
one worked in 1790 in Salem by a young girl of
ten, another in Lynn, on an English sampler in
the Kensington Museum, and in the diary of
that Boston schoolgirl, Anna Green Winslow, dated
1771.</p>

<p>There were certain variants of a popular sampler
verse that ran thus:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem">
<span class="i0">"This is my Sampler,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Here you see<br /></span>
<span class="i1">What care my Mother<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Took of me."<br /></span>
</div>

<p>Another rhyme was:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem">
<span class="i0">"Mary Jackson is my name,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">America my nation,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Boston is my dwelling place,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">And Christ is my salvation."<br /></span>
</div>

<p>The doxology, "From all that dwell below the
skies," etc., appears on samplers; and these lines:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem">
<span class="i0">"Though life is fair<br /></span>
<span class="i1">And pleasure young,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">And Love on ev'ry<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Shepherd's Tongue,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">I turn my thoughts<br /></span>
<span class="i1">To serious things,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Life is ever on the wing."<br /></span>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_333" id="Page_333">[333]</a></span></p>
<p>Another rhyme is found with varying words in
some of the lines:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem">
<span class="i0">"Young Ladyes fair when youthful minds incline<br /></span>
<span class="i1">To all that's curious, Innocent, and fine<br /></span>
<span class="i1">With Admiration let your worke be made<br /></span>
<span class="i1">The various textures and the twining thread<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Then let your fingers with unrivalled skill<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Exalt the Needle, Grace the noble Quill."<br /></span>
</div>

<p>Some of the verses are as short as the scant but
sweet English words on the sampler of Katherine,
the wife of Charles II.:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem">
<span class="i0">"21st of Maye<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Was our Wedding Daye."<br /></span>
</div>

<p>A sampler in the Old South Church in Boston
has this inscription:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem">
<span class="i0">"Dorothy Lynde is my Name<br /></span>
<span class="i1">And this Work is mine<br /></span>

<p>In the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries it was
high fashion to have mottoes and texts carved or
painted on many articles where they would frequently<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_334" id="Page_334">[334]</a></span>
catch the eye. Printed books were then rare possessions,
and these mottoes, whether of vanity or
piety, took their place. Perhaps inscriptions on
various pieces of tableware and drinking utensils
were the most common. Specially beautiful and interesting<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_335" id="Page_335">[335]</a></span>
early examples are the sets of "beechen
roundels" known to collectors; that is, sets of
wooden plates or trenchers carved with mottoes.
Women dexterous of the needle embroidered mottoes
and words on articles of clothing. Whole
texts of the Bible are said to have been inscribed
on the edges of gowns and petticoats.</p>

<div class="poem">
<span class="i0">"She is a Puritan at her needle too<br /></span>
<span class="i1">She works religious petticoats."<br /></span>
</div>

<p>Elaborate vines of flowers and other scroll designs
were worked on petticoats, often in colored crewels.
There still exists the linen petticoat of Rebecca
Taylor Orne, a Salem dame who lived to be one
hundred and twenty years old. It is deeply embroidered
with trees, vines, flowers, and fruits, on
homespun linen. Silk petticoats were also embroidered
and painted by young girls, and are beautiful
pieces of work.</p>

<p>In New York newspapers we find proof that New
York girls were taught decorative accomplishments
similar to those which were so fashionable in
Boston:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"Martha Gazley, late from Great Britain, now in the
city of New York Makes and Teacheth the following curious
Works, viz: Artificial Fruit and Flowers and other<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_336" id="Page_336">[336]</a></span>
Wax-Works, Nuns-work, Philligree and Pencil Work upon
Muslin, all sorts of Needle-Work, and Raising of Paste,
as also to Paint upon Glass, and Transparant for Sconces,
with other Works. If any young Gentlewomen, or others
are inclined to learn any or all of the above-mentioned
curious Works, they may be carefully instructed in the
same by said Martha Gazley."</p></blockquote>

<div class="caption"><p class="center">Flowered Apron</p></div>
</div>

<p>The waxwork of Martha Gazley was more fully
detailed in a school advertisement of Mrs. Sarah Wilson
of Philadelphia. She taught "waxworks in all its
branches"; flowers, fruit, and pin-baskets, also "how
to take profiles in wax." This latter was distinctly
art work; and portraits of Washington and other
Revolutionary heroes still exist in wax&mdash;a material
that could be worked with facility; but was very
perishable.</p>

<p>They were doubtless "everywhere in practice,"
in America as well, but nearly all are now but empty
names.</p>

<p>While Dutch women must be awarded the palm
of comfortable and attractive housekeeping, they did
not excel Englishwomen in needlework; though
the first gold thimble was made for Madam
Van Rensselaer, the foremother of our American
patroons; and many beautiful specimens of Dutch
embroidery exist. A sample is here shown which
was worked by Mary Richards, a granddaughter of
the famous Anneke Jans. Mrs. Van Cortlandt
wrote in her delightful account of home life in old
New York:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"Crewel-work and silk-embroidery were fashionable, and
surprisingly pretty effects were produced. Every little
maiden had her sampler which she begun with the alphabet
and numerals, following them with a Scriptural text or verse
of a psalm. Then fancy was let loose on birds, beasts and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_339" id="Page_339">[339]</a></span>
trees. Most of the old families possessed framed pieces of
embroidery, the handiwork of female ancestors."</p></blockquote>

<p>Pride in needlework, and a longing for household
decoration, found expression in quilt-piecing. Bits
of calico "chiney" or chintz were carefully shaped
by older hands, and sewed by diligent little fingers
into many fanciful designs. A Job's Trouble,
made of hexagon pieces, could be neatly done by
little children, but more complicated designs required
more "judgement," and the age of a little daughter
might be accurately guessed by her patchwork. The
quilt-making was the work of older folk. It required
long arms, larger hands, greater strength.</p>

<p>Knitting was taught to little girls as soon as they
could hold the needles. Girls four years of age
could knit stockings and mittens. In country households
young damsels knit mittens to sell and coarse
socks. Many fine and beautiful stitches were taught,
and a beautiful pair of long silk stockings of open-work
design has initials knit on the instep. They
were the wedding hose of a bride of the year 1760;
and the silk for them was raised, wound, and spun
by the bride's sister, a girl of fourteen, who also did
the exquisite knitting.</p>

<p>Lace-making was never an industry in the colonies;
it was an elegant accomplishment. Pillow
lace was made, and the stitches were taught in families<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_340" id="Page_340">[340]</a></span>
of wealth; a guinea a stitch was charged by some
teachers. Old lace pillows have been preserved to
this day, with strips of unfinished lace and hanging
bobbins, to show the kind of lace which was the
mode&mdash;a thread lace much like the fine Swiss hand-made
laces.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_341" id="Page_341">[341]</a></span></p>

<p>Tambour work on muslin or lace, and a lace made
of certain designs darned on net, took the place of
pillow lace. Nothing could be more beautiful in
execution and design than the rich veils, collars,
and caps of this worked net, which remained the
mode during the early years of this century. Girls
spent years working on a single collar or tucker.
Sometimes medallions of this net lace were embroidered
down upon fine linen lawn.
I have infants' caps of this beautiful
work, finer than any
needlework of
to-day.</p>

<h3>GAMES AND PASTIMES</h3>

<blockquote>

<p><em>The plays of children are nonsense&mdash;but very educative nonsense.</em></p>

<p><cite>&mdash;Essay on Experience. Ralph Waldo Emerson, 1860.</cite></p></blockquote>


<p>There are no more striking survivals of
antiquity than the games and pastimes of
children. We have no historians of old-time
child life to tell us of these games, but we can
get side glimpses of that life which reveal to us, as
Ruskin says, more light than a broad stare. Many
of these games were originally religious observances;
but there are scores that in their present purpose of
simple amusement date from medi&aelig;val days.</p>

<p>The chronicler Froissart, in <cite>L'Espinette Amoureuse</cite>,
tells of the sports of his early life, over five
centuries ago:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"In that early childish day<br /></span>
<span class="i1">I was never tired to play<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Games that children everyone<br /></span>

<span class="i1">A small saucer for a boat<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Down the purling gutter float:<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Over two bricks at a will<br /></span>
<span class="i1">To erect a water mill.<br /></span>
</div>

<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"In those days for dice and chess<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Cared we busy children less<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Than mud-pies and buns to make,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">And heedfully in oven bake.<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Of four bricks; and when came Lent<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Out was brought a complement<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Of river shells from secret hold,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Estimated above gold,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">To play away as I thought meet<br /></span>
<span class="i1">With the children of our street."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>"The children of our street" has a delightfully
familiar ring. He also names many familiar games,
such as playing ball, ring, prisoner's base, riddles,
and blowing soap-bubbles. Top-spinning was an
ancient game, even in Froissart's day, having been
played in old Rome and the Orient since time immemorial.</p>

<p>It is interesting to note the persistent survival of
games which are seldom learned from printed rules,
but are simply told from child to child from year
to year. On the sidewalk, in front of my house, is
now marked out with chalk the lines for a game of
hop-scotch and a group of children are playing it,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_344" id="Page_344">[344]</a></span>
precisely as I played it in my New England home
in my childhood, and as my grandfathers and grandmothers
played "Scotch-hoppers" in their day.</p>

<p>In a little century-old picture book, called <cite>Youthful
Recreations</cite>, Scotch-hoppers is named and vaguely
explained, and a note says:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"This exercise was frequently practiced by the Greeks
and Spartan women. Might it not be useful in the present
day to prevent children having chilblains?"</p></blockquote>

<p>Now isn't that stupid? Every one knows hop-scotch
time is not in the winter when the ground is
rough and frozen or wet with snow and when chilblains
are rife. It is a game for the hard, solid
earth, or a sunny pavement.</p>

<p>The variants of tag have descended to us and
are played to-day, just as they were played when
Boston and New York streets were lanes and cowpaths.
The pretty game, "I catch you without
green," mentioned by Rabelais, is well known in
the Carolinas, whither it was carried by French
Huguenot immigrants, who retained many of their
home customs as well as their language for so long
a time. Stone-tag and wood-tag took the place
in America of the tag on iron of Elizabeth's day.
Squat-tag and cross-tag have their times and seasons,
and in Philadelphia tell-tag is also played.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_345" id="Page_345">[345]</a></span>
Pickadill is a winter sport, a tag played in the snow.
Another tag game known as poison, or stone-poison,
is where the player is tagged if he steps
off stones. The little books on etiquette so frequently
read in the seventeenth century, and quoted
in other pages of this book, have this severe injunction,
"Tread not pomposely on pebblestones for it
is the art of a fool." A man who was not a fool,
one Dr. Samuel Johnson, was swayed in his walk
by similar notions.</p>

<div class="caption"><p class="center">"Scotch Hoppers," from <cite>Juvenile Games for the Four Seasons</cite></p></div>
</div>

<p>Honey pots still is played by American children.
Halliwell says the "honey pot" was a boy
rolled up in a certain stiff position. I have seen it
played by two girls carrying a third in a "chair"
made by crossing hands. In a popular little book<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_346" id="Page_346">[346]</a></span>
of the last century called <cite>Juvenile Pastimes, or Sports
for Four Seasons</cite>, the illustration shows girls playing
it. The explanatory verse reads:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem">
<span class="i0">"Carry your Honey pot safe and sound<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Or it will fall upon the Ground."<br /></span>
</div>

<p>A truly historic game taught by children to each
other, is what is called cats-cradle or cratch-cradle.
One player stretches a length of looped cords over
the extended fingers of both hands in a symmetrical
form. The second player inserts the fingers and
removes the cord without dropping the loops in
a way to produce another figure. These various
figures had childish titles. If Hone's derivation of
the game and its meaning is true, cratch-cradle is the
correct name. A cratch was a grated crib or manger.
The adjustment of threads purported to represent
the manger or cradle wherein the infant Saviour was
laid by his Virgin Mother. As little girls "take
off" the cradle they say, "criss-cross, criss-cross."
This like the criss-cross row in the hornbook was
originally Christ's cross.</p>

<p>In a quaint little book called <cite>The Pretty Little
Pocket Book</cite>, published in America at Revolutionary
times, is a list of boys' games with dingy pictures
showing how the games were played; the
names given were chuck-farthing; kite-flying;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_347" id="Page_347">[347]</a></span>
dancing round May-pole; marbles; hoop and
hide; thread the needle; fishing; blindman's buff;
shuttlecock; king am I; peg-farthing; knock out
and span; hop, skip, and jump; boys and girls
come out to play; I sent a letter to my love;
cricket; stool-ball; base-ball; trap-ball; swimming;
tip-cat; train-banding; fives; leap-frog; bird-nesting;
hop-hat; shooting; hop-scotch; squares; riding;

are given in rhyme, and to each attached a moral
lesson in verse. Some of the verses read thus:&mdash;</p>

</div></div>

<p>A few of the games are to-day unknown, or little

"Pitch and Hussel."</p>

<div class="poem">
<span class="i0">"Poise your hand fairly,<br /></span>

</div>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_348" id="Page_348">[348]</a></span></p>
<p>The game called "All the birds of the air,"
reads:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem">
<span class="i0">"Here various boys stand round and soon<br /></span>
<span class="i3">Does each some favorite bird assume;<br /></span>
<span class="i1">And if the Slave once hits his name,<br /></span>
<span class="i3">He's then made free and crowns the game."<br /></span>

<p>Mr. Newell has given a list and description of
many of the historic singing games and rounds of
American children. These were known to me in my
childhood: "Here we go round the mulberry bush;"
"Here come three Lords out of Spain;" "On the
green carpet here we stand;" "I've come to see Miss
'Ginia Jones;" "Little Sally Waters, sitting in the
sun;" "Green gravel, green gravel, the grass is so
green;" "Old Uncle John is very sick, what shall
we send him?" "Oats, pease, beans and barley
grows;" "When I was a shoemaker;" "Here I
brew, Here I bake, Here I make my Wedding
Cake;" "The needle's eye that doth supply;"
"Soldier Brown will you marry, marry me?" "O
dear Doctor don't you cry;" "There's a rose in
the garden for you, young man;" "Ring around
a rosy;" "Go round and round the valley;"
"Quaker, Quaker, How art thee?" "I put my
right foot in;" "My master sent me to you, sir;"
"London Bridge is falling down."</p>

<p>Some of these rhymes were founded on certain
lines of ballads; but without any printed words
or music we all knew them well, and the music
was the same that our mothers used&mdash;though our
mothers had not taught us. To-day children all
over the country are singing and playing these
games to the same music. I heard verse after
verse of London Bridge sung in a high key in the
shrill voices of the children of a New Hampshire
country school this winter. Such a survival in
such an environment is not strange; but it is surprising
and pathetic, too, to hear in a public primary
or a parochial school the children of German, Italian,
or Irish parentage chanting "Green gravel, green
gravel, the grass is so green," within the damp and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_350" id="Page_350">[350]</a></span>
dingy yard walls or in the basement playrooms of
our greatest city.</p>

<p>The Dutch settlers had many games. They were
very fond of bowling on the grass; a well-known
street in New York, Bowling Green, shows the
popularity of the game and where it was played.
They played "tick-tack," a complicated sort of
backgammon; and trock, on a table somewhat
like a billiard table; in it an ivory ball was struck
under wire-wickets with a cue. Coasting down
hill became a most popular sport. Many attempts
were made to control and stop the coasters. At
one time the Albany constables were ordered to
take the "small or great slees" in which "boys
and girls ryde down the hills," and break them in
pieces. At another time the boy had to forfeit
his hat if he were caught coasting on Sunday. The
sleds were low, with a rope in front, and were
started and guided by a sharp stick.</p>

<p>There is a Massachusetts law of the year 1633
against "common coasters, unprofitable fowlers and
tobacco-takers,"&mdash;three classes of detrimentals.
Mr. Ernst says coasting meant loafing along the
shore, then idling in general, then sliding down hill
for fun. In Canada they slid down the long hills
on toboggans. In New England they used a double
runner, a long narrow board platform on two sleds<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_351" id="Page_351">[351]</a></span>
or two sets of runners. Judge Sewall speaks of his
little daughter going out on sleds, but there is nothing
to indicate precisely what he meant thereby.</p>

<p>"Sports of the Innyards" languished in New
England. Innkeepers were ordered not to permit
the playing of "Dice, Cards, Tables, Quoits, Log-gats,
Bowls, Ninepins, or any other Unlawful Game
in house, yard, Garden or backside." Slide-groat
was also forbidden. Mr. Henry Cabot Lodge says
the shovel-board of Shakespeare's day was almost the
only game that was tolerated. This game was perhaps
the most popular of old-time domestic pastimes,
and was akin to slide-groat.</p>

<p>I found nothing to indicate that the cruel sport
known as cock-throwing, cock-steling, or cock-squoiling
ever prevailed in America. In this sport
the cock was tied by a short cord to a stake, and
boys at a distance of twenty yards took turns at
throwing sticks at him till he was killed. This
sport was as old as Chaucer's time, and universal
among the English.</p>

<p>Judge Sewall wrote of Shrove Tuesday in Boston
in 1685 that there was great disorder in Boston by
reason of "cock-skailing." Another year he tells
of a young lad going through Boston streets "carrying
a cock on his back and a bell in his hand."
Several friends followed him, loosely blindfolded and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_352" id="Page_352">[352]</a></span>
carrying cart whips; and under pretence of striking
at him managed to distribute their blows with stinging
force on the gaping crowd around. This was
an old English custom. At a later date the sport
of shying at leaden cocks prevailed. The "dumps"
which were thrown, and the crude little images of lead
and pewter shaped like a cock, were often made and
sold by apprentices as part of their perquisites.</p>

<p>Cock-fighting was popular in the Southern colonies
and New York. There are prohibitions against
it in the rules of William and Mary College. Certainly
it was not encouraged or permitted here as
in English schools, where boys had cock-fights in
the schoolroom; and where that great teacher,
Roger Ascham, impoverished himself with dicing
and cock-fighting. Cock-fights were often held on
Shrove Tuesday. The picture of Colonel Richard
Wynkoop, shown on the opposite page, was painted
when he was twelve years old; the dim figures of
two fighting cocks can be seen by his side. They
are obscured by the sword which the colonel carried
during the Revolution, and which is thrust in front
of the picture. The cruel Dutch sport of riding
for the goose, was riding at full speed to catch a
swinging greased goose. Young lads sometimes
took part in this, but no small boys.</p>

<p>In <cite>The Schole of Vertue</cite>, 1557, we read:&mdash;</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_353" id="Page_353">[353]</a></span></p>

<div class="poem">
<span class="i0">"O, Lytle childe, eschew thou ever game<br /></span>
<span class="i1">For that hath brought many one to shame.<br /></span>
<span class="i1">As dysing, and cardynge, and such other playes<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Which many undoeth, as we see nowe-a-dayes."<br /></span>
</div>

<p>Playing cards were fiercely hated, and their sale
prohibited in Puritan communities, but games of
cards could not be "beaten down." Grown folk
had a love of card-playing and gaming which seemed
almost hereditary. But I do not believe young
children indulged much in card-playing in any of
the colonies.</p>

<p>William Bradford, then governor of the colony at
Plymouth, thus grimly records in his now famous
Log-book, the first Christmas Day in that settlement:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"The day called Christmas Day ye Gov<sup>r</sup> cal'd them
out to worke (as was used) but ye moste of this new company
excused themselves, and saide y<sup>t</sup> went against their
consciences to work on y<sup>t</sup> Day. So ye Gov<sup>r</sup> tould them
that if they made it mater of conscience, he would spare
them till they were better informed. So he led away ye
rest and left them; but when they came home at noon
from their work he found them in ye street at play openly,
some pitching ye bar, and some at stoolball and such like
sports. So he went to them and took away their implements
and tould them it was against his conscience that
they should play and others work."</p></blockquote>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_354" id="Page_354">[354]</a></span></p>

<p>The exact description of this game I do not know.
Dr. Johnson says it is a play where balls are driven
from stool to stool, which may be a good definition,
but is a very poor explanation.</p>

<p>The <cite>Pretty Little Pocket Book</cite> says vaguely:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem">
<span class="i0">"The ball once struck with Art and Care<br /></span>
<span class="i1">And drove impetuous through the Air,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Swift round his Course the Gamester flies<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Or his Stools are taken by surprise."<br /></span>
</div>

<p>At the end of the seventeenth century a French
traveller, named Misson, wrote a very vivacious
account of his travels in England. He sagely noted
English customs, fashions, attributes, and manners;
and airily discoursed on the English game of football:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"In winter football is a useful and charming exercise.
It is a leather ball about as big as one's head, fill'd with
wind. This is kick'd about from one to tother in the
streets, by him that can get it, and that is all the art of it."</p></blockquote>

<p>That is all the art of it! I can imagine the sentiments
of the general reader of that day (if any
general reader existed in England at that time),
when he read and noted the debonair simplicity of
this brief account of what was even then a game of
so much importance in England. The proof that
Misson was truly ignorant of this subject is shown<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_355" id="Page_355">[355]</a></span>
in the fact that he could by any stretch of an
author's privileged imagination call the English
game of foot-ball
of that day "a
useful and charming
exercise."
Nothing could be
further from the
Englishman's intent
than to make
it either profitable
or pleasing.</p>

<p>In the year
1583 a Puritan,
named Phillip
Stubbes, horror-stricken
and sore
afraid at the many
crying evils and
wickednesses
which were rife
in England, published
a book which he called <cite>The Anatomie of Abuses</cite>.
It was "made dialogue-wise," and is one of the most
distinct contributions to our knowledge of Shakespeare's
England. Written in racy, spirited English,
it is unsparing in denunciations of the public<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_356" id="Page_356">[356]</a></span>
and private evils of the day. His characterization
of the game of foot-ball is one of the strongest and
most fearless of his accusations:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"Now who is so grosly blinde that seeth not that these
aforesaid exercises not only withdraw us from godliness and
virtue, but also haile and allure us to wickednesse and sin?
For as concerning football playing I protest unto you that
it may rather be called a friendlie kinde of fyghte than a
play or recreation&mdash;a bloody and murthering practice than
a felowly sport or pastime. For dooth not everyone lye in
waight for his adversarie, seeking to overthrowe him and
picke him on his nose, though it be uppon hard stones, in
ditch or dale, in valley or hill, or whatever place soever it
be hee careth not, so hee have him downe; and he that
can serve the most of this fashion he is counted the only
fellow, and who but he?... So that by this means
sometimes their necks are broken, sometimes their backs,
sometimes their legs, sometimes their armes, sometimes
their noses gush out with blood, sometimes their eyes start
out, and sometimes hurte in one place, sometimes in another.
But whosoever scapeth away the best goeth not
scot free, but is either forewounded, craised, or bruised, so
as he dyeth of it or else scapeth very hardlie; and no mervaile,
for they have the sleights to meet one betwixt two,
to dash him against the hart with their elbowes, to hit him
under the short ribs with their griped fists and with their
knees to catch him on the hip and pick him on his neck,
with a hundred such murthering devices."</p></blockquote>

knees to catch him on the hip and pick him on the
neck."</p>

<p>Stubbes may be set down by many as a sour-visaged,
sour-voiced Puritan; but a very gracious
courtier of his day, an intelligent and thoughtful
man, Sir Thomas Elyot, was equally severe on the
game. He wrote, in 1537, <cite>The Boke named the Gouvernour</cite>,
full of sensible advice and instruction. In
it he says:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"Foot-ball wherein is nothynge but beastlye furie and
exstreme violence, whereof proceedeth hurte; and consequently
malice and rancour do remayne with them that
be wounded; whereof it is to be putt in perpetuall silence."</p></blockquote>

<p>The "perpetuall silence" which he put on the
game has not fallen even by the end of three centuries
and a half.</p>

<p>Some indirect testimony as to the character of the
English game comes from travellers in the American
colonies, where the American Indians were found
playing a game of foot-ball like that of their white
brothers. John Dunton, travelling in New England<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_358" id="Page_358">[358]</a></span>
when Boston was half a century old, tells of the
Indians' game:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"There was that day a great game of Foot-ball to be
played. There was another Town played against 'em as
is sometimes common in England; but they played with
their bare feet, which I thought very odd; but it was upon
a broad sandy Shoar free from Stones which made it the
more easie. Neither were they so apt to trip up one another's
heels and quarrel as I have seen 'em in England."</p></blockquote>

<p>At the same time English boys were kicking the
foot-ball around Boston streets, and were getting
themselves complained of by game-hating Puritan
neighbors, and enjoined by pragmatical magistrates,
just as they were in English towns.</p>

<p>Fewer games are played now by both boys and
girls than in former times, in England as well
as America. In a manuscript list of games played
at Eton in 1765 are these titles: cricket, fives,
shirking walls, scrambling walls, bally cally, battledore,
pegtop, peg in the ring, goals, hop-scotch,
heading, conquering cobs, hoops, marbles, trap ball,
steal baggage, puss in the corner, cat gallows, kites,
cloyster and hyer gigs, tops, humming tops, hunt
the hare, hunt the dark lanthorn, chuck, sinks, stare-caps,
hurtlecap. No games are now recognized at
Eton save cricket, foot-ball, and fives. Racquet
and hockey flourished for a time. The playing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_359" id="Page_359">[359]</a></span>
of marbles was abandoned about 1820, and top-spinning
about 1840. Top-time had always opened
ten days after the return to school after the summer
holidays. Hoops were made of stout ash laths
with the bark on, and the hoop-rolling season ended
with a class fray with hoopsticks for weapons. At
one time marble-playing was prohibited in the English
universities. It is not probable that those
undergraduates habitually played marble any more
than do our Princeton University men, who have
a day of marble-playing and one of top-spinning
each spring.</p>

<p>A record of old-time sports would be incomplete
without reference to the laws of sport times. These
are as firmly established as the seasons, and as
regular as the blooming of flowers. Children cannot
explain them, nor is there any leader who establishes
them. It is not a matter of reason; it is instinct. A
Swiss writer says that boys' games there belong chiefly
to the first third of the year, always return in the
same order, and "without the individual child being
able to say who had given the sign, and made the
beginning." From Maine to Georgia the first time
is, has been (and we may almost add "ever shall be
world without end"), marble time. Then come tops.
The saying is, "Top time's gone, kite time's come,
April Fool's Day will soon be here." Ball-playing
in Boston had as its time the first Thursday in April.
Whistle-making would naturally come at a time
when whistle wood was in good condition. All
the boys in all the towns perch on stilts as closely in
unison as the reports of a Gatling gun. There is
much sentiment in the thought that for years, almost
for centuries, thousands of boys in every community
have had the same games
at the same time, and the
recital almost reaches
the dignity of
history.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XVIII</h2>

<h3>CHILDREN'S TOYS</h3>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0"><em>Behold the child, by nature's kindly law</em><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><em>Pleased with a rattle, tickled with a straw.</em><br /></span>

</div></div>


<p>In the year 1695 Mr. Higginson wrote from
Massachusetts to his brother in England, that
if toys were imported in small quantity to
America they would sell. In very small quantity,
we fancy, though the influence of crown and court
began to be felt in New England, and many articles
of luxury were exported to that colony as they
were to Virginia.</p>

<p>According to our present ideas, playthings for
children in colonial time were few in number, save
the various ones they manufactured for themselves.
They played more games, and had fewer toys than
modern children. In 1712, on the list of rich
goods brought into Boston by a privateersman and
sold there, were "Boxes of Toys." In 1743 the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_362" id="Page_362">[362]</a></span>
<cite>Boston News Letter</cite> advertised "Dutch and English
Toys for Children," and Mr. Ernst says Boston had
a flourishing toy shop at that date. Other towns did
not, as we know from
many shipping orders.</p>

</div>

<p><cite>The Toy Shop or Sentimental
Preceptor</cite>, one
of Newbery's books,
gives a list of toys
which the young English
scholar sought;
they are a looking-glass,
a "spying glass,"
a "fluffed dog," a
pocket-book, a mask,
a drum, a doll, a watch,
a pair of scales. Few
of these articles named
would really be termed
toys. Some of the
games already alluded
to, such as top-spinning,
hoop-rolling, and the various games of ball,
required toys to carry them on; but they seemed
to fall into classification more naturally in the
chapter on games than in this one.</p>

<div class="figcenter bord" style="width: 450px;"><a name="old" id="old"></a>

<div class="caption"><p class="center">An Old Doll</p></div>
</div>

<p>I have often been asked whether the first childish<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_363" id="Page_363">[363]</a></span>
girl emigrants to this solemn new world had the comfort
of dolls. They certainly had something in the
semblance of a doll, though far removed from the
radiant doll creatures of this day; little puppets,
crude and shapeless, yet ever beloved symbols
of maternity, have been known to children in
all countries and all ages; dolls are as old as the
world and human life. In the tombs of Attica are<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_364" id="Page_364">[364]</a></span>
found classic dolls, of ivory and terra-cotta, with
jointed legs and
arms. Sad little toys
are these; for their
human guardians are
scattered dust. Dolls
were called puppets
in olden times, and
babies. In the <cite>Gentleman's
Magazine</cite>,
London, September,
1751, is an early use
of the word doll,
"Several dolls with
different dresses
made in St. James
Street have been sent
to the Czarina to
show the manner of
dressing at present in
fashion among English
ladies." This
circulation of dressed
dolls as fashion transmitters
was a universal
custom. Fashion-plates
are scarce more<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_365" id="Page_365">[365]</a></span>
than a century old in use. Dolls were sent from
house to house, from town to town, from country to
country, and even to a new continent.</p>

<div class="figcenter bord" style="width: 267px;"><a name="french" id="french"></a>
<img src="images/i119.jpg" width="267" height="600" alt="French doll" />
<div class="caption"><p class="center">French Doll</p></div>
</div>

<p>These babies for fashion models came to be
made in large numbers for the use of milliners;
and as the finest ones came from the Netherlands,
they were called "Flanders babies." To the busy
fingers of Dutch children, English and American
children owed many toys besides these dolls. It
was a rhymed reproach to the latter that&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem">
<span class="i0">"What the children of Holland take pleasure in making,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">The children of England take pleasure in breaking."<br /></span>
</div>

<p>Fashions changed, and the modish raiment grew
antiquated and despised; but still the "Flanders
babies" had a cherished old age. They were
graduated from milliners' boxes and mantua-makers'
show rooms to nurseries and play-rooms where they
reigned as queens of juvenile hearts. There are old
ladies still living who recall the dolls of their youth
as having been the battered fashion dolls sent to
their mammas.</p>

<p>The best dolls in England were originally sold at
Bartholomew Fair and were known as "Bartholomew
babies." The English poet, Ward, wrote:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem">
<span class="i0">"Ladies d'y want fine Toys<br /></span>
<span class="i1">For Misses or for Boys<br /></span><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_366" id="Page_366">[366]</a></span>
<span class="i1">Of all sorts I have Choice<br /></span>
<span class="i3">And pretty things to tease ye.<br /></span>
<span class="i1">I want a little Babye<br /></span>
<span class="i1">As pretty a one as may be<br /></span>
<span class="i3">With head-dress made of Feather."<br /></span>
</div>

<p>In <cite>Poor Robin's Almanack</cite>, 1695, is a reference to
a "Bartholomew baby trickt up with ribbons and
knots"; and they were known at the time of the
landing of the Pilgrims. Therefore it is not impossible
that some Winslow or Winthrop maid, some
little miss of Bradford or Brewster birth, brought
across seas a Bartholomew baby and was comforted
by it.</p>

<p>A pathetic interest is attached to the shapeless
similitude of a doll named Bangwell Putt, shown
facing page 370. It is in the collection at Deerfield
Memorial Hall. It was cherished for eighty
years by Clarissa Field of Northfield, Massachusetts,
who was born blind, and whose halting but
trusting rhymes of longing for the clear vision of
another world are fastened to the plaything she
loved in youth and in old age.</p>

<p>Nothing more absurd could be fancied than the
nomenclature "French" attached to the two shapeless,
inelegant creatures, a century old, shown on
pages 364 and 367. Yet gawky as they are, they
show signs of hard usage, which proves them to have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_367" id="Page_367">[367]</a></span>
had a more beloved life than the case of elegant
Spanish dolls, on page 389, which were evidently
too fine ever to
be touched. The
"White House
Doll" spent the
days of her youth
in the White
House at Washington,
with the
children of the
President, John
Quincy Adams,
and is still cherished
by his descendants.</p>

<div class="caption"><p class="center">French Doll</p></div>
</div>

<p>Skilful jackknives
could manufacture
home-made
dolls' furniture.
Birch
bark was especially
adaptable to
such uses. The
wicker cradles and "chaises" of babies were copied
in miniature for dolls. Tin toys were scarce, for
tin was not much used for domestic utensils. A<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_368" id="Page_368">[368]</a></span>
tin horse and chaise over a hundred years old is
shown on page 373, and a quaint plaything it is.
The eternal desire of a child for something suggestive
of a horse found satisfaction in home-made
hobby-horses; and, when American ships wandered
over the world in the India trade, they brought
home to American children strange coaches and
chariots of gay colors and strange woods; these
were often comical copies of European shapes,
sometimes astonishingly crude, but ample for the
ever active imagination of a child to clothe with
beautiful outlines. An old coach is shown on
page 369, with the box in which it was originally<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_369" id="Page_369">[369]</a></span>
packed. It is marked Leghorn, but is doubtless
Chinese.</p>

<p>The word "jack" as a common noun and in compound
words has been held to be a general term
applied to any contrivance which does the work of
a boy or servant, or a simple appliance which is
subjected to common usage. In French the name
Jacques was a term for a young man of menial condition.
The term "country jake" is of kindred
sense. Jack lord, jack meddler, jackanapes, Jack
Tar, smoke-jack, jack-o'-lantern, black-jack, jack-rabbit,
the term jack applied to the knave in playing
cards, and the expressions jack-at-a-pinch, jack
in office, jack in bedlam, jack in a box, jack of all
trades, and many others show the derivative meaning.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_370" id="Page_370">[370]</a></span>
Hence jack-knife may mean a boy's knife.
In English dialect the word was jack-lag-knife,
also jack-a-legs, in Scotch, jock-te-leg&mdash;these by a
somewhat fanciful derivation said to be from Jacques
de Liege, the celebrated cutler.</p>

<div class="figcenter bord" style="width: 450px;"><a name="knives" id="knives"></a>
<img src="images/i123.jpg" width="450" height="258" alt="knives" />
<div class="caption"><p class="center">Old Jack-knives</p></div>
</div>

<p>A good jack-knife was the most highly desired
possession of a boy. Days of weary work and
hours of persistent pleading were gone through with
in hundreds of cases before the prize was secured.
Barlow knives had a century of popularity. Some
now in Deerfield Memorial Hall are here shown.
Note the curved end, a shape now obsolete, but in
truth an excellent one for safe pocket carriage.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_371" id="Page_371">[371]</a></span>
Knives of similar shape have been found that are
known to be a century and a half old. I have
never seen in America any of the old knives used
as lovers' tokens, with mottoes engraved on them,
referred to by Shakespeare. The boy's stock of
toys was largely supplied by his own jack-knife:
elder pop-guns, chestnut and willow whistles, windmills,
water-wheels, box-traps, figure 4 traps. Toy
weapons have varied little from the Christian era
till to-day. Clubs, slings, bows and arrows, air-guns,
are as old as the year One. Ere these were
used as toys, they had been formidable weapons.
They were weapons still, for some years of colonial
life. In 1645 the court of Massachusetts ordered
that all boys from ten to sixteen years old should
be exercised with bows and arrows.</p>

<p>Skating is an ancient pastime. As early as the
thirteenth century Fitzstephen tells of young Londoners
fastening the leg-bones of animals to the
soles of the feet, and then pushing themselves on
the ice by means of poles shod with sharp iron
points.</p>

<p>Pepys thought skating "a very pretty art" when
he saw it in 1662, but it was then a novelty to him,
and he was characteristically a little afraid of it;
justly disturbed, too, that the Duke of York would
go "though the ice was broken and dangerous, yet<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_372" id="Page_372">[372]</a></span>
he would go slide upon his scates which I did not
like&mdash;but he slides very well."</p>

<div class="caption"><p class="center">White House Doll</p></div>
</div>

<p>Wooden skates shod with iron runners were invented
in the Low Countries. Dutch children in
New Netherlands
all skated, just as
their grandfathers
had in old Batavia.
The first skates that
William Livingstone
had on the
frozen Hudson were
made of beef bones,
as were those of
medi&aelig;val children.
In Massachusetts
and Connecticut,
skating was among
the many Dutch
ways and doings
practised by English
folk in the new
world. The Plymouth Pilgrims brought these
Dutch customs to the new world through their
long and intimate sojourn in Holland; the New
Haven and Connecticut Valley settlers learned them
through their constant trade and intercourse with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_373" id="Page_373">[373]</a></span>
their neighbors, the Dutch of Manhattan; but the
Massachusetts Bay settlers of Boston and Salem
had known these Dutch ways longer,&mdash;they
brought them from England across seas, from the
counties of Essex and Suffolk, where the Dutch
had gone years before and married with the
English.</p>

<div class="caption"><p class="center">Old Tin Toy</p></div>
</div>

<p>New England boys in those early days went
skating on thin ice and broke through and were
drowned, just as New England boys and girls are
to-day, alas! Judge Sewall wrote in his diary on the
last day in November, in 1696, that many scholars<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_374" id="Page_374">[374]</a></span>
went to "scate" on Fresh Pond, and that two
boys, named Maxwell and Eyre, fell in and were
drowned.</p>

<div class="caption"><p class="center">Doll's Wicker Coach</p></div>
</div>

<p>Advertisements of men's and boys' skates and of
"Best Holland Scates of Different Sizes," show a
constant demand and use. In an invoice of "sundry
merchandise" to Weathersfield, Connecticut, in
the year 1763, are twelve pair "small brass scates,
@ 3/&mdash;&pound;3, 16/." I do not know the age of the
skates shown opposite page 346. No date less
than a hundred years ago is ever willingly assigned<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_375" id="Page_375">[375]</a></span>
to such relics. They are similar in shape to the
ones shown on page 349, in the illustration taken
from a book for children entitled <cite>Children's Sports</cite>,
published a century ago, which ends its dissertation
on skating with this sensible advice:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"'Tis true it looks exceeding nice<br /></span>
<span class="i1">To see boys gliding on the ice,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">And to behold so many feats<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Perform'd upon the sliding skates,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">But before you venture there<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Wait until the ice will bear,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">For want of this both young and old<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Have tumbled in,&mdash;got wet and cold."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>It was not until October, 1771, that a pleasure-filled
item appeared, "Boys' Marbles." In <cite>The
Pretty Little Pocket Book</cite> are these lines:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i4">"MARBLES<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Knuckle down to your Taw.<br /></span>
<span class="i3">Aim well, shoot away.<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Keep out of the Ring,<br /></span>
<span class="i3">You'll soon learn to Play.<br /></span>

<span class="i3">And drives every State.<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Then improve each Moment,<br /></span>

</div></div>


<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_376" id="Page_376">[376]</a></span></p>
<p>Boys played with them precisely as boys do now.
The poet Cowper in his <cite>Tirocinium</cite> says of the
games of his school life:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem">
<span class="i0">"The little ones unbutton'd, glowing hot<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Playing our games and on the very spot<br /></span>
<span class="i1">As happy as we once, to kneel and draw<br /></span>
<span class="i1">The chalky ring, and knuckle down at taw."<br /></span>
</div>

<p>The terms used were the same as those heard
to-day in school yards: taws, vent, back-licks,
rounces, dubs, alleys, and alley-taws, agates, bull's-eyes,
and commoneys. Jackstones was an old
English game known in Locke's day as dibstones.
Other names for the game were chuckstones,
chuckie-stones, and clinches. The game is precisely
the same as was played two centuries ago;
it was a girl's game then&mdash;it is a girl's game now.</p>

<p>Battledores and Shuttles were advertised for sale
in Boston in 1761; but they are far older than
that. Many portraits of children show battledores,
as that of Thomas Aston Coffin. All books of
children's games speak of them. It was,
in fact, a popular game, and deemed
a properly elegant exercise for
decorous young misses
to indulge
in.</p>

<p>The records of childish flower lore contained
in this chapter are those of my own childhood;
but they are equally the records of
the customs of colonial children, for these games
and rhymes and plays about flowers have been preserved
from generation to generation of New England
children. The transmission of this nature lore<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_378" id="Page_378">[378]</a></span>
has been as direct and unaltered in the new world
as in Great Britain. Some of these customs, such
as the eating of hollyhock cheeses and the blowing
of dandelion clocks, came originally, as have other
play usages, from England; many were varied in
early years by different conditions in the new world,
by local fitness and suggestion.</p>

<p>One chapter in Mr. Newell's book upon the
<cite>Games of American Children</cite> dwells upon the conservatism
of children. The unquestioning reception
of play formulas, which he proves, extended
to the flower rhymes and lore which I have recollected
and herein set down. These inherited
customs are far dearer to children than modern inventions.
There is a quaintness of expression, a
sentiment of tradition, that the child feels without
power of formulating.</p>

<p>If the paradise of the Orientals is a garden, so
was a garden of old-fashioned flowers the earthly
paradise for a child: the long sunny days brought
into life so many delightful playthings to be made
through the exercise of that keen instinct of all children,
destructiveness. Each year saw the fresh retelling
and teaching of child to child of happy flower
customs almost intuitively, or through the "knowledge
never learned at schools," that curious subtle
system of transmission which everywhere exists<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_379" id="Page_379">[379]</a></span>
among children who are blessed enough to spend
their summer days in the woods or in a garden.
The sober teachings of science in later years can
never make up the loss to those who have lived
their youth in great cities, and have grown up debarred
from this inheritance, knowing not when</p>

<p>
"The summer comes with flower and bee."<br />
</p>

<p>The dandelion was the earliest flower to stir the
children's memories; in New England it is "the
firstling of the year." In the days of my childhood
we did not wait for the buttercup to open to learn
whether we "loved butter"; the soft dimpled chin
of each child was held up, as had been those of other
children for past decades, to catch the yellow reflection
of the first dandelion on the pinky throat.</p>

<p>The dandelion had other charms for the child.
When the blooms had grown long-stemmed through
seeking the sun from under the dense box borders,
what pale green, opal-tinted curls could be made by
splitting the translucent stems and immersing them
in water, or by placing them in the mouth! I taste
still their bitterness! What grace these curls conferred
when fastened to our round combs, or hung
over our straight braids!&mdash;far better than locks of
corn silk. And what adorning necklaces and chains
like Indian wampum could be made by stringing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_380" id="Page_380">[380]</a></span>
"dandelion beads," formed by cutting the stems
into sections! This is an ancient usage; one
German name of the flower is chain-flower. The
making of dandelion curls is also an old-time
childish custom in Germany. When the dandelion
had lost her golden locks, and had grown
old and gray, the children still plucked the downy
heads, the "clocks" or blowballs, and holding aloft
these airy seed vessels, and fortifying the strong
young lungs with a deep breath, they blew upon
the head "to see whether my mother wants me,"
or to learn the time o' day.</p>

<p>The ox-eye daisy, the farmer's whiteweed, was
brought to New England, so tradition tells, as a
garden flower. Now, as Dr. Holmes says, it whitens
our fields to the great disgust of our liberal shepherds.
It soon followed the dandelion in bloom,
and a fresh necklace could be strung from the starry
blossoms, a daisy chain, just as English children
string their true pink and white daisies. This daisy
was also used as a medium of amatory divination,
by pulling from the floret the white ray flowers,
saying, "He loves me, he loves me not," or<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_381" id="Page_381">[381]</a></span>
by repeating the old "apple-seed
rhyme":&mdash;</p>

<p>Flower oracles are medi&aelig;val,
and divination by leaves of grass.
Children to-day, as of old, draw
grass stalks in the field and match
them to see who will be "It."
Walther von der Vogelweide
(1170-1230) did likewise:&mdash;</p>

<span class="i0">"A spire of grass hath made me gay&mdash;<br /></span>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_382" id="Page_382">[382]</a></span></p>
<p>The yellow disk, or "button," of the ox-eye
daisy, which was formed by stripping off the white
rays, made a pretty pumpkin pie for the dolls' table.
A very effective and bilious old lady, or "daisy
grandmother," was made by clipping off the rays to
shape the border or ruffle of a cap, leaving two long
rays for strings, and marking in a grotesque old
face with pen and ink. A dusky face, called with
childish plainness of speech a "nigger head," could
be made in like fashion from the "black-eyed
Susan" or "yellow daisy," which now rivals the
ox-eye daisy as a pest of New England fields.</p>

<p>Though the spring violets were dearly loved, we
slaughtered them ruthlessly by "fighting roosters"
with them. The projecting spur under the curved
stem at the base of the flower was a hook, and when
the violets "clinched" we pulled till the stronger
was conqueror, and the weaker head was off.</p>

<p>What braided "cat-ladders," and quaint, antique-shaped
boats with swelling lateen sail and pennant
of striped grass could be made from the flat, sword-like
leaves of the "flower-de-luce!" Filled with
flowers, these leafy boats could be set gayly adrift
down a tiny brook in the meadow, or, with equal
sentiment, in that delight of children since Froissart's
day, the purling gutter of a hillside street
after a heavy midsummer shower. The flowers<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_383" id="Page_383">[383]</a></span>
chosen to sail in these tiny crafts were those most
human of all flowers, pansies, or their smaller
garden sisters, the "ladies'-delights" that turned
their laughing, happy faces to us from every nook
and corner of our garden. The folk names of this
flower, such as "three-faces-under-a-hood," "johnny-jump-up,"
"jump-up-and-kiss-me," "come-tickle-me,"
show the universal sense of its kinship to
humanity. I knew a child who insisted for years
that pansies spoke to her. Another child, who had
stolen a rose, and hidden it under her apron, called
out pettishly (throwing the rose in a pansy bed),
"Here! take your old flower"&mdash;as the pansy
faces blinked and nodded knowingly to her.</p>

<p>The "dielytra" (bleeding-heart, or lady's-eardrops
we called it) had long, gracefully drooping racemes
of bright red-pink flowers, which when pulled apart
and straightened out made fairy gondolas, or which
might be twisted into a harp and bottle. How
many scores have I carefully dissected, trying to
preserve intact in skeleton shape the little heart-shaped
"frame" of the delicate flower! The
bleeding-heart is a flower of inexplicable charm to
children; it has something of that mystery which
in human nature we term fascination. Little children
beg to pick it, and babies stretch out their tiny
hands to it when showier blossoms are unheeded.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_384" id="Page_384">[384]</a></span></p>

<p>What black-headed puppets or dolls could be
made from the great poppies, whose reflexed petals
formed gay scarlet petticoats; and also from the
blossoms of vari-colored double balsams, with their
frills and flounces! The hollyhock, ever ready to
render to the child a new pleasure, could be tied into
tiny dolls with shining satin gowns, true fairies.
Families&mdash;nay, tribes of patriarchal size had the
little garden-mother. Mertensia, or lungwort, we
termed "pink and blue ladies." The lovely blossoms,
which so delighted the English naturalist
Wallace, and which he called "drooping porcelain-blue
bells," are shaped something like a child's
straight-waisted, full-skirted frock. If pins are stuck
upright in a piece of wood, the little blue silken
frocks can be hung over them, and the green calyx
looks like a tiny hat. A child friend forbidden to
play with dolls on the solemn New England Sabbath
was permitted to gather the mertensia bells on
that holy day, and also to use the cherished income
of a prosperous pin store. It was discovered with
maternal horror that she had carefully arranged her
pink and blue ladies in quadrilles and contra-dances,
and was very cheerfully playing dancing party, to
beguile the hours of a weary summer Sunday
afternoon.</p>

<p>Mr. Tylor, the author of <cite>Primitive Culture</cite>, call<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_385" id="Page_385">[385]</a></span>
our attention to the fact that many of the beloved
plays of children are only sportive imitations of the
serious business of life. In some cases the game
has outlived the serious practice of which it is a
copy&mdash;such as the use of bows and arrows. Children
love to produce these imitations themselves
with what materials they can obtain, not to have
them provided in finished perfection. Thus the
elaborately fitted-up doll's house and imitation grocery
store cannot keep the child contented for days
and weeks as can the doll's room or shop counter
furnished by the makeshifts of the garden. The
child makes her cups and saucers and furniture herself.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_386" id="Page_386">[386]</a></span>
She prepares her own powders and distillations
and is satisfied.</p>

<p>A harvest of acorn cups furnished table garniture,
but not a cherished one; they were too
substantial; we preferred more fragile, more perishable
wares. Rose-hips were fashioned into tiny
tea-sets, and would not be thought to be of great
durability. A few years ago I was present at the
opening of an ancient chest which had not been
thoroughly searched for many years. In a tiny
box within it was found some cherished belongings
of a little child who had died in the year
1794. Among them was one of these tea-sets made
of rose-hips, with handles of bent pins. Though
shrunken and withered, the rose-hips still possessed
some life color, but they soon fell into dust. There
was something most tender in the thought of that
loving mother, who had herself been dead over
half a century, who had thus preserved the childish
work of her beloved daughter.</p>

<p>Poppy pericarps made famous pepper-boxes, from
which the seed could be shaken as pepper; dishes
and cups, too, for dolls' tea-tables, and tiny handles
of strong grass stems could be attached to the cups.
For the child's larder, hollyhocks furnished food in
their mucilaginous cheeses, and the insipid akenes
of the sunflower and seeds of pumpkins swelled the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_387" id="Page_387">[387]</a></span>
feast. A daintier morsel, a drop of honey, the "clear
bee-wine" of Keats, could be sucked from the curved
spur of the columbine, and the scarlet-and-yellow
trumpet of the beautiful coral honeysuckle, mellifluous
of the name, as well as from the tubes of the
heads of clover. We ate rose-leaves, also, and grass
roots, and smarting peppergrass. The sorrel and
oxalis (which we called "ladies' sorrel") and the curling
tendrils of grape-vines gave an acid zest to our
childish nibblings and browsings.</p>

<p>The gnarled plum trees at the end of the garden
exuded beautiful crystals of gum, of which we could
say proudly, like Cornelia, "These are my jewels."
Translucent topaz and amber were never more
beautiful, and, void of settings, these pellucid gems
could be stuck directly on the fingers or on the tip
of the ear. And when our vanity was sated with the
bravery, or we could no longer resist our appetite,
there still remained another charm: with childish
opulence, like Cleopatra, we swallowed our jewels.</p>

<p>A low-growing mallow, wherever it chanced to
run, shared with its cousin hollyhock the duty of
providing cheeses. These mallow cheeses were also
eaten by English children. In allusion to this the
poet Clare wrote:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem">
<span class="i0">"The sitting down when school was o'er<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Upon the threshold of the door,<br /></span><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_388" id="Page_388">[388]</a></span>
<span class="i1">Picking from mallows, sport to please,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">The crumpled seed we call a cheese."<br /></span>
</div>

<p>These flower customs never came to us through
reading. All our English story-books told of making
cowslip balls, of breaking the shepherd's purse,
of playing lords and ladies with the arum&mdash;what
we call jack-in-the-pulpit; yet we never thought of
making any kindred attempts with these or similar
flowers. We did gather eagerly the jack-in-the-pulpit,
whose singularity of aspect seems always to
attract the attention of children, and by pinching it at
the base of the flower made it squeak, "made Jack
preach." But like true republicans we never called
our jacks lords and ladies.</p>

<p>The only liking we had for the portulaca was in
gathering the seeds which grew in little boxes with
a lid opening in a line around the middle. Oh,
dear! It doesn't seem like the same thing to hear
these beloved little seed-boxes described as "a pyxis,
or a capsule with a circumscissile dehiscence."</p>

<p>From the live-for-ever, or orpine (once tenderly
cherished as a garden favorite, now in many localities
a hated and persistent weed), we made frogs, or
purses, by gently pinching the fleshy leaves between
thumb and forefinger, thus loosening the
epidermis on the lower side of the leaf and making
a bladder which, when blown up, would burst with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_389" id="Page_389">[389]</a></span>
a delightful pop. The New England folk-names
by which this plant is called, such as frog-plant,
blow-leaf, pudding-bag plant, show the wide-spread
prevalence of this custom. A rival in sound
could be made by popping the foxglove's fingers.
English countrywomen call the foxglove a pop.
The morning-glory could also be blown up and
popped, and the canterbury-bell. We placed rose
petals and certain tender leaves over our lips, and
drew in the centres for explosion.</p>

<div class="figcenter bord" style="width: 450px;"><a name="spanish" id="spanish"></a>
<img src="images/i131.jpg" width="450" height="258" alt="Spanish" />
<div class="caption"><p class="center">Spanish Dolls</p></div>
</div>

<p>Noisy boys found scores of other ways to make
various resounding notes in the gardens. A louder
pop could be made by placing broad leaves on the
extended thumb and forefinger of one hand and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_390" id="Page_390">[390]</a></span>
striking them with the other. The boys also made
squawks out of birch bark and fiddles of cornstalks
and trombones from the striped prickly leaf-stalks
of pumpkins and squashes.</p>

<p>The New England chronicler in rhyme of boyhood
days, Rev. John Pierpont, called this sound
evoked from the last-named instrument "the deeper
tone that murmurs from the pumpkin leaf trombone."
It is, instead, a harsh trumpeting. These
trombones were made in Germany as early as the
thirteenth century.</p>

<p>An ear-piercing whistle could be constructed from
a willow branch, and a particularly disagreeable
sound could be evoked by every boy, and (I must
acknowledge it) by every girl, too, by placing broad
leaves of grass&mdash;preferably the pretty striped ribbon-grass,
or gardener's garters&mdash;between the thumbs
and blowing thereon. Other skilful and girl-envied
accomplishments of the boys I will simply name:
making baskets and brooches by cutting or filing
the furrowed butternut or the stone of a peach;
also fairy baskets, Japanesque in workmanship, of
cherry stones; manufacturing old-women dolls of
hickory nuts; squirt-guns and pop-guns of elderberry
stems; pipes of horse-chestnuts, corn-cobs, or
acorns, in which dried sweet-fern could be smoked;
sweet-fern or grape-stem or corn-silk cigars.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_391" id="Page_391">[391]</a></span></p>

<p>Some child customs successfully defy the law of
the survival of the useful, and ignore the lesson of
reason; they simply exist. A marked example
of these, of bootless toil, is the laborious hoarding
of horse-chestnuts each autumn. With what eagerness
and hard work do boys gather these pretty
nuts; how they quarrel with one another over the
possession of every one; how stingily they dole out
a few to the girls who cannot climb the trees, and
are not permitted to belabor the branches with
clubs and stones for dislodgment of the treasures,
as do their lordly brothers! How carefully the
gathered store is laid away for winter, and not one
thing ever done with one horse-chestnut, until all
feed a grand blaze in the open fireplace! At the
time of their gathering they are converted to certain
uses, are made into certain toys. They are tied to
the ends of strings, and two boys, holding the
stringed chestnuts, play cob-nut. Two nuts are
also tied together by a yard of cord, and, by a
catching knack, circled in opposite directions. But
these games have a very emphatic time and season,&mdash;the
weeks when the horse-chestnuts ripen. The
winter's store is always untouched.</p>

<p>From a stray burdock plant which had escaped
destruction in our kitchen garden, or from a group
of these pestilent weeds in a neighboring by-path,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_392" id="Page_392">[392]</a></span>
could be gathered materials for many days of
pleasure. The small, tenacious burs could be easily
wrought into interesting shapes. There was a
romance in our neighborhood about a bur-basket.
A young man conveyed a written proposal of marriage
to his sweetheart reposing in one of the spiny
vehicles. Like the Ahkoond of Swat, I don't know
"why or which or when or what" he chose such an
extraordinary medium, but the bur-basket was forever
after haloed with sentiment. We made from
burs more prosaic but admirable furniture for the
dolls' house,&mdash;tables, chairs, and cradles: Traces
of the upholstery clung long and disfiguringly to
our clothing, but never deterred us from the fascinating
occupation. To throw these burs upon
each other's clothing was held to be the commission
of the unpardonable sin in childish morals; still it
was done "in holiday foolery," as in Shakespeare's
day.</p>

<p>The milkweed, one of our few native weeds, and
a determined settler on its native soil, furnished
abundant playthings. The empty pods became
fairy cradles, and tiny pillows could be made of the
beautiful silk. The milkweed and thistle both furnish
pretty, silvery balls when treated with deft
fingers; and their manufacture is no modern fashion.
Manasseh Cutler, writing in 1786, says:&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_393" id="Page_393">[393]</a></span></p>

<blockquote>

<p>"I was pleased with a number of perfectly white silken
balls, as they appeared to be, suspended by small threads
along the frame of the looking-glass. They were made
by taking off the calyx of the thistle at an early stage of
blooming."</p></blockquote>

<p>Ingenious toys of amusing shapes could be
formed of the pith of the milkweed, and when
weighted with a tack would always fall tack downward,
as did the grotesque corn-stalk witches.</p>

<p>Pressed flowers were devoted to special uses. I
cannot recall pressing any flower save larkspur,&mdash;the
"lark-heels" of Shakespeare. Why this flower
was chosen I do not know, unless for the reason
that its colors were so enduring. We used to make
charming wreaths of the stemless flowers by placing
the spur of one in the centre of another flower, and
thus forming a tiny circle. A favorite arrangement
was alternating the colors pink and blue. These
stiff little pressed wreaths were gummed on a sheet
of paper, to be used at the proper time as a valentine,&mdash;were
made for that definite purpose; yet I
cannot now recall that, when February came, I ever
sent one of these valentines, or indeed had any to
send.</p>

<p>I have found these larkspur wreaths in a Pike's
Arithmetic, used a century ago, and also in old
Bibles, sometimes fastened in festoons on the title-page,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_394" id="Page_394">[394]</a></span>
around the name of a past owner. Did Dr.
Holmes refer to one when he wrote his graceful
line, "light as a loop of larkspur"? A similar
wreath could be made of the columbine spurs. A
friend tells me she made scores in her youth; but
we never pressed any flowers but larkspur.</p>

<p>Many pretty wreaths were made of freshly gathered
flowers. The daintiest were of lilac or phlox
petals, which clung firmly together without being
threaded, and the alternation of color in these
wreaths&mdash;one white and two purple lilac petals,
or two white phlox petals and two crimson&mdash;could
easily prove the ingenuity and originality of the
child who produced them. In default of better-loved
flowers, the four-o'clock, or marvel-of-Peru,
was made into a similar garland.</p>

<p>In the beautiful and cleanly needles of the pine
the children had an unlimited supply for the manufacture
of toys. Pretty necklaces could be made for
personal adornment, resembling in miniature the
fringed bark garments of the South Sea Islanders,
and tiny brooms for dolls' houses. A thickly growing
cluster of needles was called "a lady." When
her petticoats were carefully trimmed, she could be
placed upright on a sheet of paper, and by softly
blowing upon it could be made to dance. A winter's
amusement was furnished by gathering and storing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_395" id="Page_395">[395]</a></span>
the pitch-pine cones and hearing them snap open
in the house. The cones could also be planted
with grass-seeds, and form a cheerful green growing
ornament.</p>

<p>From birch bark gathered in long wood walks
could be made cornucopias and drinking-cups, and
letters could be cut thereon and thereof. There
wandered through the town, harmless and happy,
one of "God's fools," whose like is seen in every<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_396" id="Page_396">[396]</a></span>
country community. He found his pleasure in
early autumn in strolling through the country, and
marking with his jack-knife, in cabalistic designs,
the surface of all the unripe pumpkins and squashes.
He was driven by the farmers from this annoying
trespass in the daytime, but "by brave moonshine"
could still make his mysterious mark on the harvest
of the year. The boys of the town, impressed by
the sight of a garden or field of squashes thus curiously
marked, fell into a habit of similar inscription,
which in them became wanton vandalism, and had
none of the sense of baffled mystery which always
hung around and illumined poor Elmer's letters. A
favorite manner of using the autumn store of pumpkins
was in the manufacture of Jack-o'-lanterns,
which were most effective and hideous when lighted
from within.</p>

<p>"The umbrellas are out!" call country children
in spring, when the peltate leaves of the May apple
spread their umbrella-shaped lobes, and the little
girls gather them, and the leaves of the wild sarsaparilla,
for dolls' parasols. The spreading head of
what we called snake grass could also be tied into
a very effective miniature parasol. There is no
sense of caste among children when in a field or
garden&mdash;all are equally well dressed when "bedizened
and brocaded" with garden finery. Green<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_397" id="Page_397">[397]</a></span>
leaves can be pinned with their stems into fantastic
caps and bonnets; foxglove fingers can be used as
gloves; the blossoms of the jewelweed make pretty
earrings; and the dandelion and daisy chains are not
the only necklaces,&mdash;the lilac and larkspur chains
and pretty little circlets of phlox are proudly worn;
and strings of rose-hips end the summer. The old
English herbalist says "children with delight make
chains and pretty gewgaws of the fruit of roses."
Truly, the garden-bred child walks in gay attire
from May to October.</p>

<p>The "satten" found by the traveller Josselyn, in
seventeenth-century New England gardens, formed
throughout New England a universal plaything, and
a frequent winter posy, in country parlors, on mantel
or table. The broad white oval partition, of satiny
lustre, remaining after the side valves had fallen,
made juvenile money, and the plant went by the
appropriate name of money-in-both-pockets.</p>

<p>Other seeds were gathered as the children's spoils:
those of the garden balsam, to see them burst, or to
feel them curl up in the hand like living creatures;
those of the balsam's cousin, the jewelweed, to watch
them snap violently open&mdash;hence its country
name of touch-me-not and snapweed. When the
leaves were hung with dew it deserved its title
of jewelweed, and when they were immersed in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_398" id="Page_398">[398]</a></span>
water its other pretty descriptive folk name of
silver-leaf.</p>

<p>A grotesquery could be formed from the seed-pods
in the centre of the peony, when opened, in
such a way that the tiny pink and white seeds resembled
two sets of teeth in an open mouth. Imaginary
miniature likenesses were found in the various
parts of many flowers: the naked pistil and stamens
of one were a pair of tongs; another had a seed
ovary which was a lady, a very stout lady with extending
hoops. The heart's-ease had in its centre
an old lady washing her feet; the monk's-hood, a
devil in his chariot. A single petal of the columbine,
with attached sepals, was a hovering dove, and
the whole flower&mdash;Izaak Walton's "culverkeys"&mdash;formed
a little dish with a ring of pigeon-heads
bending within.</p>

<p>There were many primitive inks and staining
juices that could be expressed, and milks and gums
that exuded, from various plants. We painted
pictures in our books with the sap from the petals
of the red peonies, and blue juice from the blossom
of the spiderwort, or tradescantia, now a neglected
flower. We dyed dolls' clothes with the juice
of elderberries. The country child could also dye
a vivid red with the juice of the pokeberry, the
"red-ink" plant, or with the stems of the bloodroot;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_399" id="Page_399">[399]</a></span>
and the sap crushed from soft, pulpy leaves,
such as those of the live-for-ever, furnished a green
stain.</p>

<p>There was a certain garden lore connected with
insects, not so extensive, probably, as a child would
have upon a farm. We said to the snail:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem">
<span class="i0">"Snail, snail, come out of your hole,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Or else I will beat you as black as a coal."<br /></span>
</div>

<p>We sang to the lady-bug:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem">
<span class="i0">"Lady-bug, lady-bug, fly away home;<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Your house is on fire, your children will burn."<br /></span>
</div>

<p>We caught the grasshoppers, and thus exhorted
them:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem">
<span class="i0">"Grandfather, grandfather gray,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Give me molasses, or I'll throw you away."<br /></span>
</div>

<p>We believed that earwigs lived for the sole purpose
of penetrating our ears, that dragon-flies flew with
the sole thought of sewing up our lips&mdash;devil's
darning-needles we called them. To this day I
instinctively cover my mouth at their approach.
We used to entrap bumble-bees in the bells of
monopetalous flowers such as canterbury-bells, or
in the ample folds of the hollyhock, and listen to
their indignant scolding and buzzing, and watch
them gnaw and push out to freedom. I cannot
recall ever being stung in the process.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_400" id="Page_400">[400]</a></span></p>

<p>We had the artistic diversion of "pin-a-sights."
These were one of the shop-furnishings of pin
stores, whose curious lore, and the oddly shaped
and named articles made for them, should be recorded
ere they are forgotten. A "pin-a-sight"
was made of a piece of glass, on which were stuck
flowers in various designs. Over these flowers was
pasted a covering of paper, in which a movable flap
could be lifted, to display, on payment of a pin, the
concealed treasures. We used to chant, to entice
sight-seers, "A pin, a pin, a poppy-show." This
being our rendering of the word "puppet-show."
I recall as our "sights" chiefly the tiny larkspur
wreaths before named, and miniature trees carefully
manufactured of grass-spires. A noted "pin-a-sight,"
glorious still in childish history and tradition,
was made for my pin-store by a grown-up girl of
fourteen. She cut in twain tiny baskets, which she
pasted on glass, and filled with wonderful artificial
flowers manufactured out of the petals of real blossoms.
I well remember her "gilding refined gold"
by making a gorgeous blue rose out of the petals of
a flower-de-luce.</p>

<p>I cannot recall playing much with roses; we fashioned
a bird out of the buds. The old English
rhyme describing the variation of the sepals was
unknown to us:&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_401" id="Page_401">[401]</a></span></p>

<div class="poem">
<span class="i0">"On a summer's day in sultry weather<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Five brethren were born together:<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Two had beards, and two had none,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">And the other had but half a one."<br /></span>
</div>

<p>Still, with the rose is connected one of my most
tender child memories,&mdash;somewhat of a gastronomic
cast, yet suffused with an element of grace,&mdash;the
making of "rosy-cakes." These dainty fairy cakes
were made of layers of rose-leaves sprinkled with
powdered sugar and cinnamon, and then carefully
enfolded in slips of white paper. Sometimes they
were placed in the garden over night, pressed between
two flat stones. As a morsel for the epicure
they were not altogether alluring, although inoffensive,
but decidedly preferable to pumpkin or sunflower
seeds, and they were englamoured with
sentiment; for these rosy-cakes were not destined
to be greedily eaten by the concocter, but were to
be given with much secrecy as a mark of affection,
a true love token, to another child or some beloved
older person, and were to be eaten also in secret.
I recall to this day the thrill of happiness which the
gift of one of these little paper-inclosed rosy-cakes
brought to me, in the days of my childhood, when
it was slipped into my hand by a beautiful and gentle
child, who died the following evening, during a
thunder-storm, of fright. The tragedy of her death,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_402" id="Page_402">[402]</a></span>
the memory of the startling glimpses given by the
vivid lightning, of agitated running to and fro in the
heavy rain and lowering darkness, and the terrified
summons of kindly neighbors,&mdash;all have fixed more
firmly in my mind the happy recollection of her
last gift.</p>

<p>Another custom of my youth was watching at
dusk the opening of the twisted buds of the garden
primrose into wan, yellow stars, "pallid flowers, by
dew and moonlight fed," which filled the early evening
with a faint, ineffable fragrance that drew a host
of encircling night moths. Keats said they "leaped
from buds into ripe flowers," a habit thus told by
Margaret Deland:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem">
<span class="i0">"Here, in warm darkness of a night in June,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;* children came<br /></span>
<span class="i1">To watch the primrose blow.<br /></span>
<span class="i24">Silent they stood,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Hand clasped in hand, in breathless hush around,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">And saw her shyly doff her soft green hood<br /></span>
<span class="i1">And blossom&mdash;with a silken burst of sound!"<br /></span>
</div>

<p>In our home garden stood a clump of tall primroses,
whose beautiful flowers, when opened, were
four inches in diameter. When riding, one summer
evening, along a seaside road on Cape Ann,
we first saw one of these queens of the night in an
humble dooryard. In the dark its seeds were gathered<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_403" id="Page_403">[403]</a></span>
and given by an unknown hand and a flower-loving
heart to my mother, to form under her "fair
tendance" the luminous evening glory of her garden.
And on summer nights this stately primrose still
blooms in moonlight and starlight, though the gentle
hand that planted it is no longer there:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem">
<span class="i0">"Yon rising Moon that looks for us again<br /></span>
<span class="i1">How oft hereafter will she wax and wane<br /></span>
<span class="i3">How oft hereafter look for us<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Through this same Garden&mdash;and for <em>one</em> in vain."<br /></span>
</div>

<p>To every garden-bred child the sudden blossoming
and pale shining in the gloaming have ever given
the evening primrose a special tender interest,&mdash;a
faintly mystic charm through the chill of falling dew
and the dim light, and through a half-sad atmosphere
which has always encircled the flower, and has been
felt by many of the poets, making them seldom sing
the evening primrose as a flower of happiness.
With the good night of children
to the flowers, I close this
record of old-time
child life.</p>

<h2>Home Life in Colonial Days</h2>

<h3>By ALICE MORSE EARLE</h3>

<p class="center">Cloth. 12mo. $2.50</p>


<p><strong>Boston Herald</strong>:</p>

<p>"A good many books have been written about the lives and customs of
our ancestors of colonial times, and especially about the differences between
their lives and ours and the primitive and picturesque utensils which they
employed in their households. These have been partly the outcome and
partly the prompting agency of the rage for antiques. Various writers have
unearthed a large amount of curious lore, which is not all of equal value,
though almost every hint that has come through their pages goes to recreate
the atmosphere and reveal the conditions pertaining to the earliest
pioneers in North America. Mrs. Alice Morse Earle has done a great
deal of good work in this field. Probably it is quite within bounds to say
that she possesses a larger fund of vivacious and interesting knowledge
about the lives and the works, the occupations and makeshifts, the industries
and enjoyments, of the Puritans and the other early colonists than any
other student in this rich domain."</p>

<p><strong>Philadelphia Evening Telegraph</strong>:</p>

<p>"Mrs. Earle, as many readers have discovered, is one of the most painstaking
and agreeable of antiquarians. The present book is one of her
best."</p>

<p><strong>Democrat and Chronicle, Rochester</strong>:</p>

<p>"Touches a most fascinating phase of American history.... The
story, which has been patiently gathered from many sources and historical
records, is told in a graphic and charming manner, and is pictured by
nearly 200 illustrations ... certainly a contribution to our history of very
high value."</p>

<p><strong>The Herald, Boston</strong>:</p>

<p>"Full of new information and description of surprisingly fresh interest
... no other single volume with which we happen to be acquainted constructs
with such completeness, fairness, and suggestiveness, the atmosphere
of colonial homes."</p>

<p><strong>Buffalo Commercial</strong>:</p>

<p>"One of the handsomest books that we have received."</p>

<p>Stories of the rise and decline of buccaneering and piracy in our West Indian waters. Spanish
exactions grew so monstrous in the seventeenth century that English, French, and Dutch combined
against their excesses. The buccaneers who were the result of the combination became later pirates
for private gain. Mr. Stockton's quaint humor brightens the stories of their dark deeds in characteristic
style. The book is unique.</p>

Illustrated by <span class="smcap">E. C. Peixotto</span>.</p>

<p>A narrative of the life of the pioneers of Tennessee and their fortunes at the hands of the Cherokees
in the uprising of 1760. The brilliant Tennessee landscape and the old frontier fort serve as a background
to this picture of Indian craft and guile and pioneer hardships and pleasures.</p>

<p>Adown a shallow stream we sent our leafy boats
with swelling sail, and floating pennant of striped
grass. Freighted with flowers beloved of children,
the laughing pansies,&mdash;for thoughts,&mdash;we thrust
them heedlessly forth with never a care whether
boat or crew e'er reached a harbor.</p>

<p>Out into the world on the stream of the fast-hurrying
century I send this paper boat&mdash;my book&mdash;laden
with thoughts of children's lives. Grown
careful with years, I crave for it a safe journey and
sheltered harbor. Perhaps the craft may bear to
some reader a memory of his own childhood,
as well as stories of the children of an
ancient day; a day so gray and sad as
seen through the haze of centuries
that the only cheerful
light is found in the
faces of the
children.</p>

works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE

defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO OTHER

warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit:  www.gutenberg.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For forty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
